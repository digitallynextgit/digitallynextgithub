    "content": "<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The best way to find the relevant topic to engage your audience is to know who your audience is. In other words, put yourself in their shoes and then think of a topic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>#Select a newsworthy topic or something which is in TREND!</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Be the first one to cash in on latest trends. Writing on latest trends is a great way to engage your audience and grow your audience at the same time. Write on something that is so good that people want to talk about it. Your audience should feel like telling about it to the world. This would surely increase the engagement on your blog.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>#Choose topics that are little edgy to write on</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Make people inquisitive about the blog. Let the topic be bold and catch reader&rsquo;s attention. It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to write on something which is considered negative or wrong at that point. Sometimes you need to push your limits to get that extra attention. Everyone loves to read some juicy things. Give that taste to your readers. You don&rsquo;t need to write on something which is not true but you can always give your point of view. Ultimately, it is your blog and only you get to decide what to write and what not. You need to keep in mind that blogs are in abundance, what are you offering that audience should be diverted to you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Pen-down those topics which are not very general and write them in detail. Investing more time is more fruitful than anything. Remember, one good blog is better than two not-so-good blogs. Keep your headlines crisp as they can make or break the success of your content.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>#Forget this &lsquo;log kya kahenge&rsquo;</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You need to remember that your audience is not there for some piece of plain information. They want to know something extra.&nbsp; If you want to write that controversial statement, go for it. Don&rsquo;t think what &lsquo;log kya kahenge&rsquo;. That is your space and you own it. People know Arnab Goswami because he crossed that bridge of what people will say. He literally owned his show. You should know everyone looks for quality content and once they get what they are looking for they tend to stick to it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>#Ripples</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Any topic you may choose but it would thrive on the ripples it would create. This could be through any medium. So make sure that your topic and its content should leave an audience with a thought to ponder even after they have finished reading it. They should keep it in their short-term memory. Ultimately the more people talk about it the more audience you will have on your blog.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>#Experiment with the way you write</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There are lot more to publish than just a straight blog post. Sometimes a topic would be interesting but its writing style would kill it. Options are what everyone looks for, try to give the same to your readers. The other styles can be:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Video</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Infographics</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Interview style</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Story Telling</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When adopting different styles, you increase your chances of tapping a different set of audience which you could&rsquo;ve missed out because of the same style.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>#Close the loop</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Everything said and done but by you! Getting feedback should be your topmost priority. If you want to build up your audience and keep them from fading away, ask your audience what&rsquo;s missing or what you could do to get the word out there more. Ask them what interests them the most, call them forward, let them tell their stories and you never know you can get your jackpot topic from their suggestions only</span></p>",

Email hygiene is essential if you want to avoid spamming. Technical factors for the domain and IP address need to be set, and one should ensure the content of the email address matches specific standards to avoid spam filters.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Below is the guide that improves the email deliverability</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Seven tips to improve email deliverability</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SPF Record Setup</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PTR Record Setup</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Domain Keys Identified Mail</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Warm Up Sending IPs</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Reputation</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Email Validation</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spam Traps</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>SPF Record Setup</strong>&nbsp;</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SPF stands for Sender Policy Framework. It is a type of TXT record in your DNS zone file. SPF records make it easy to identify which mail servers are authenticated to send an email for a particular domain and which are not. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">SPF records use the DNS TXT record to point out all allowed hostnames and IP addresses authorized to send an email on behalf of a domain. SPF enables mail servers to check if a sender is spoofing Email from your domain, which is happening a lot nowadays.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>PTR Record Setup</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">PTR is a pointer record that helps resolve an IP address to a fully qualified domain name, opposite to what a record does. PTR record is also known as Reverse DNS records. It is used to check that the server name is associated with the same IP address from where the connection was initiated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It ensures that the IP address and domain have matching forward and reverse DNS records as it is a significant boost to your sender score. Mail services use a PTR record as a spam filter.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Domain Keys Identified Mail</strong>&nbsp;</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is defined as an email authentication method designed to detect forged sender addresses in emails, a technique often used in phishing and email spam. It further helps the receiver check that an email claimed to have come from a specific domain was authorized by the owner of that domain.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Warm Up Sending IPs</strong>&nbsp;</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is said that warming up sending IP addresses can favorably impact your email deliverability. One can start by sending 50 emails per day per IP address and then double the number every 3 to 5 days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> It is suggested that message those subscribers only who have been active on your list recently, such as clicking or opening previous statements.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Reputation</strong>&nbsp;</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Now day&rsquo;s reputation is essential for each brand, and so is the same for the platforms used for marketing your products and services. If we talk about emails, it should be written so that it doesn&rsquo;t look like spam. To avoid this unwanted spamming, you should take care of the IP address. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Because Email received from an IP address associated with spamming or unwanted email marketing is a red flag for all mail service providers. It is recommended to monitor your IP address frequently to maintain a reputation before mail drops. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If your IP address is listed with any public blacklists online, that allows your IP to be removed within 24 hours. Multi RBL can be used for checking if your server&rsquo;s IP address is blacklisted.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Email Validation&nbsp;</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Email validation helps in verifying if an email address is deliverable and valid. To keep the low bounce rate and healthy reputation with the email service providers, you should keep only valid email addresses in your lists. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Removing invalid and deactivated email accounts from the list can improve your chances of reaching the inbox throughout an entire email marketing campaign.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Spam Traps</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These are mail addresses that are the same as your real email addresses, but these are used to identify spammers. Due to these spam traps theirs comes the problem in email deliverability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can avoid this by removing invalid emails regularly and re-conforming the inactive subscribers that help you to remove them from your list.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Email marketing is great tool and still relevant because almost everyone has one email id.&nbsp; But the way email marketing has been done over long time got changed, now it is done in&nbsp; with more customization and relevancy.</span></p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content clear\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\">High Quality vs Low Quality Backlinks</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We already read tons about low-quality backlinks and unnatural backlinks. What about the high-quality ones? These are those that get your site upper and upper within the SERPs, so let&rsquo;s focus for a moment and see what&rsquo;s so different between a high-quality link versus a traditional link.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">From the purpose of jumping into a replacement business and landing on the primary page in program results, there&rsquo;s an extended way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The SEO land is filled with bad tips for getting backlinks from spammy websites and dealing with shady SEO consultant which will bring your site in no time on the primary page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Which is essentially impossible to try to do in brief amount of time, if you would like to grow your backlinks profile naturally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">From a generic point of view the overall important characteristics of a top-quality link are:</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Domain Authority</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If an important domain has backlinks to your site, there&rsquo;s a good chance that your website has something important to mention in your niche, similar to real life, if an important person mentions you, the impression of the listeners will be influenced by his high authority in the field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">That way your importance will grow and it can bring a rise in organic traffic, conversion rate.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Relevance</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A relevant backlink is a link that is positioned on a site/page that talks about the same subject, or is in the same niche with your site. The relevance of a link may be given based on the content of the linking site or page and the contextual relevance of the words surrounding the link.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Uniqueness</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A high-quality link has even more power, if it&rsquo;s hard for your competitors to get a natural link from the same source. Links from relevant and authority sites that only talk about your website and not your competitors can be considered great link opportunities because they are unique to your site.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A quick example of such a link, would be conference sites that link to the companies and speakers that are participating at that conference.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Naturally, not all your competitors can be present at that conference so that is a great place to build some high quality and unique links to your site.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Traffic</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If a link isn&rsquo;t clicked, then the initial purpose of the link is voided. it&rsquo;s important to have your link during a visible place on the positioning so that people click it and thus drive traffic to your site. for example, footer links can&rsquo;t be considered important as they&rsquo;re only seen by search engine crawlers and are rarely clicked by people.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A footer link on a popular domain such as <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://quora.com/\">Quora</a> can have a major influence on your site and it can help you improve your rankings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">On the opposite hand, multiple footer backlinks to your website from sites that connected with one another can bring you a Google Penguin penalty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">From a technical point of view, Model the properties of a high-quality link which are as follows:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of domain</span></h5>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">From a High Authority Referring Domain.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Linking Domain Ranks Well in Google.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Linking Domain features a lot of Referring Domains.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;Relevance of page/site</span></h5>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In the Same Niche as your site</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Links mostly to content within the same niche.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;Uniqueness in terms of website</span></h5>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Does not link to all of your competitors.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Links to Informational sources mostly.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp; Website traffic and visibility</span></h5>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Has a Big Number of visitors?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Has a lively Readership.

Advertisement market is expected to decrease by more than 8.7%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The remarkable durability of movie entertainment adspend within this season of a worldwide outbreak and following collapse may be the result of greater demand by consumers, higher distribution of content, and intense rivalry among video brands for audiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Equipped with spending a whole lot more time at home, consumers looked into video to maintain themselves entertained and informed. Back in France, as an instance, television viewing time was 30 percent greater in April, also has been still 11 percent higher in August.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Meanwhile on the web video programs have spent considerable sums in creating material to draw new audiences, forcing conventional broadcasters to up their game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Adspend by online-video brands has surpassed conventional tv recently. In the united states, on the web video brands raised their advertising budgets by 142 percent in 2019, whilst tv brands raised their spending 15%. In the United Kingdom, adspend by online-video programs rose by 79 percent, whilst adspend by conventional tv climbed 34 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In both markets, both tv broadcasters and paytv platforms pushed spending temporarily in a reaction for their brand-new rivalry, but that can prove unsustainable facing a continuing decline in their earnings, both COVID-19-related and structural.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Brands which offer persuasive adventures and behave as more than repositories of video content will probably be best placed for growth in the very long run.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Lock-down has made electronic much more critical to movie/video brands.</strong></span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Video entertainment brands allocate more to digital advertisements, out-of-home and theatre compared to the ordinary brand. Their dependence on out-of-home and theatre has introduced a specific challenge this season since they will have been made to pay for lost crowds out of vacant cities and shut cinemas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This implies much more digital spending, which is predicted to grow from 53 percent of overall video entertainment pay in 20-19 to 57 percent in 2020.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Video content advertisement spends forecasted to decrease 2019 all-time high by approximate 1.2percent in 2020.</strong></span></h6>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Although movie entertainment is predicted to outperform the industry in 2020, Zenith predicts it to underperform within the subsequent couple of decades, without the increase in 2021 and a 1.3% increase in 20 22.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 20-22, video entertainment brands are predicted to spend 27 percent more than in 20-19 in Spain, and 19 percent more in India. Meanwhile, the spending is anticipated to decline by 5 percent in the united states and 7 percent in Australia within the same period.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Spain and India both have hastened appetites for video OnDemand, notably on smartphones in India. India&rsquo;s tv advertising market additionally appreciates rapid long-term growth, unlike in the majority of Western states.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Even the US will be the only market where video entertainment adspend is likely to diminish after 2020, as increasing online earnings don&rsquo;t pay for its ongoing declines in television advertisements and pay-tv subscriptions, reducing available advertisement budgets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\" data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;The video business is in good shape in Australia; however, the advertising market for a whole is retrenching after the abrupt block to Australia&rsquo;s 29 years of unbroken economic growth.</span></p>",

For example, if you are a new accountancy firm providing bookkeeping services so you would like to target small companies in specific industries such as Real Estate which will be buying your availing your service.</p>\n<p><strong>It could be a list of shortlisted buyer character, it includes geography, industry, business size, and function (or the designation/department that the man or woman is in).</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-27040\" style=\"width: 970px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LinkedIn-Members-1024x575.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LinkedIn-Members-1024x575.webp 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LinkedIn-Members-300x168.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LinkedIn-Members-768x431.webp 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LinkedIn-Members-1536x862.webp 1536w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LinkedIn-Members.webp 1600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\"></figure>\n<p><strong>4. Leads from Prospect Page</strong></p>\n<p>A prospect&rsquo;s page may tolerate an abundance of information and contributes to other individuals, too (after all, if you wish to locate people like your potential, your best bet is to look at who they&rsquo;re mingling with).</p>\n<p><strong>You can even mine leads in the prospects&rsquo; profile by assessing their connections. If you have already filled out your Revenue Preferences, you will also receive a listing of guide recommendations based on the metrics you have set.</strong></p>\n<p>Always add tag with prospects mentioning how did you got that prospect and for what reason he is your prospect so that you can start conversation in a better way.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Initiate conversation with your contacts in powerful way</strong></p>\n<p>Now you&rsquo;ve become an expert in identifying leads through the Revenue Navigator software. Now your real work starts: contacting the prospects you have specified.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the basic principles still hold up: you&rsquo;ve got hardly any time to create an impact on this person. What should you do?</p>\n<p><strong>A fantastic profile can do half of the job for you, so be sure you have a prominent and fascinating headline with a solid value proposition. Be sure you&rsquo;re using unique content, not rehashing boilerplate messages that everyone has seen a few hundred times.</strong></p>\n<p>As soon as you start emailing your prospects, you will realize that it is highly restricted! Do not worry, though; there&rsquo;s a workaround. Start looking for opportunities with Open Profiles.</p>\n<p>Do not leave leads dangling, if you have sent a link request, do not leave the person hanging once they respond! It is always good to respond with a thank you note for the link and ask a telephone to take the issue forward.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to leverage specific dates (for example, quarterly ends, celebratory occasions, etc.) and create messaging around the event given as a method of establishing an ongoing relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Assess how good you&rsquo;re using the Social Selling Index</strong></p>\n<p>To ensure you get the best results from Revenue Navigator and understand what pain areas you have been facing, you will have to track and manage each engagement you&rsquo;ve got on the platform.</p>\n<p>Social Selling LinkedIn is a straightforward tool that tells you how you have been using the Revenue Navigator.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-27041\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/perfect-linkedin-profile-1-20240819-6724390.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/perfect-linkedin-profile-1-20240819-6724390.webp 595w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/perfect-linkedin-profile-1-20240819-6724390-300x200.webp 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"595\" height=\"396\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p><strong>The Social Selling LinkedIn Index measures your performance on four indicators: your specialist branding, connecting with the proper people, whether you are engaging with the insights, and how you are building relationships.</strong></p>\n<p>You can find a maximum of 25 on each index, and the scores are tabulated per week &ndash; so you can also evaluate how you have been performing over some time.</p>\n<p>Why should you concentrate on this?

Blogging</strong>:</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-27031\" style=\"width: 933px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-start-a-blog-2.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-start-a-blog-2.webp 595w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-start-a-blog-2-300x200.webp 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"595\" height=\"396\"></figure>\n<p>This can be a powerful medium for digital campaigns to attract targeted traffic.</p>\n<p><em>Hubspot&rsquo;s State of Inbound Report found that&nbsp;</em><em>digital campaigns that blog, generate 97% more inbound links to their website.</em></p>\n<p>Hence, being a key element of content marketing, blogging is an effective SEO strategy if ample high-quality, keyword-laden write ups on relevant topics are dangled before the target demographic. This improves your site&rsquo;s search engine rankings and drive more organic traffic to your website in addition to amplifying brand awareness.</p>\n<p>By including Calls-to-Action (CTAs) in the blog posts, such as offering a free sample e-book in exchange of contact information and email, one can wheedle out information and generate leads for the sales team to follow up for the long haul.</p>\n<p>The report &ldquo;The Ultimate List of Blogging Statistics and Facts&rdquo; by OptinMonster cites myriad studies that show the effectiveness of blogging, including:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Companies that blog generate&nbsp;<strong>126%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>more leads</strong>&nbsp;than those that don&rsquo;t.</li>\n<li>Blog posts with images get&nbsp;<strong>94% more views</strong>&nbsp;than those without.</li>\n<li>Companies that blog&nbsp;<strong>16 or more times per month get 4.5x&nbsp;</strong><strong>more leads&nbsp;</strong>than those that blog 0-4 times per month.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-27032\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jkjhhj-1024x535.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jkjhhj-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jkjhhj-300x157.jpg 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jkjhhj-768x401.jpg 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jkjhhj.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"535\"></figure>\n<p><strong>2. Retargeting Ads:<br></strong></p>\n<p><em>A study by Retargeter concluded that retargeting ads can lead to a&nbsp;</em><em>147% increase in average conversion rates.</em></p>\n<p>Thus, retargeting is an essential audience-building mechanism.</p>\n<p>For example, Facebook advertising allows businesses to target ads based on location, age, interests, and more. With set parameters about your preferred audience&rsquo;s online behaviors, interests, and demographic details, retargeting will place ads before those who would like to work with or buy from you.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>MarketingSherpa</strong>&nbsp;study claims that retargeting ads can result in a towering 726% lift in site visitation after 4 weeks of continued ad exposure.</p>\n<p>Not out of sight, not out of mind!</p>\n<p>The ads serve as a reminder of or introduction to your value. A report by&nbsp;<strong>Google</strong>&nbsp;found that retargeting ads can increase&nbsp;<strong>brand recall by 104%, search queries by 85%, and website visits by 50%.</strong></p>\n<p>Seeing how many conversions come through and where they come from can help you fine-tune future campaigns even more meticulously.</p>\n<p><strong>3.

Quora Answers:</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-27034\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/quora5914.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/quora5914.jpg 866w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/quora5914-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/quora5914-768x576.jpg 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"866\" height=\"650\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>As per Quora, the platform has over 300 million monthly active users.

Email Marketing:</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-27035\" style=\"width: 755px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/email-marketing-examples_29.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/email-marketing-examples_29.webp 595w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/email-marketing-examples_29-300x200.webp 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"595\" height=\"396\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>Email marketing is a very effective and inexpensive digital strategy.</p>\n<p>Compared to other digital tactics, eMarketer reports that email can generate 4x the ROI. For that reason, it&rsquo;s the go-to strategy for most businesses.</p>\n<p>All that&rsquo;s needed is persuasive text from the subject line to the body, a timeline that fits with marketing goals, an enticing call-to-action, and a great landing page.</p>\n<p>However, being cost-effective doesn&rsquo;t mean that digital campaigns are cheap.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Creating a digital campaign</strong>&nbsp;requires a significant investment of time and effort as well as skilled professionals to execute them. Companies need to hire skilled professionals such as graphic designers, content writers, and social media managers to create and execute a digital campaign effectively.</p>\n<p>These professionals require adequate compensation for their services, which can add to the overall cost of the campaign.</p>\n<p>According to a survey by the&nbsp;<strong>Content Marketing Institute</strong>, businesses spend an average of&nbsp;<strong>26% of their total marketing budget on content marketing.</strong></p>\n<p>While this is a relatively small percentage, it still represents a significant investment.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Digital campaigns demand companies</strong>&nbsp;to invest in marketing automation tools, data analytics tools, social media management tools, email marketing tools, and other technologies to execute a successful digital campaign.</p>\n<p>A study by the&nbsp;<strong>DMA</strong>&nbsp;found that the average ROI for email marketing is&nbsp;<strong>$42 for every $1 spent.</strong>&nbsp;While this clinches a prominent return on investment, it still needs a gigantic upfront investment in email marketing software, design, and content creation.</p>\n<p>These tools require a significant financial investment, which adds to the overall cost of the campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The cost of digital advertising platforms</strong>&nbsp;and channels continues to rise. Platforms like Google and Facebook have increased their advertising costs, making it harder for small businesses to compete.</p>\n<p>A study by&nbsp;<strong>AdEspresso</strong>&nbsp;found that&nbsp;<strong>the average cost per click for Facebook ads is $1.72, while the average cost per impression is $7.19.</strong></p>\n<p>While these costs vary depending on the audience and targeting, they are still a substantial expense.</p>\n<p>Digital campaigns require a budget allocation to pay for advertising fees, which adds to the overall cost of the campaign.</p>\n<p>According to the&nbsp;<strong>Hootsuite</strong>&nbsp;findings, the average social media advertising budget is&nbsp;<strong>$50,000 per year</strong>. While this is significantly less than the cost of traditional advertising, it still represents a significant investment for many businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> while digital campaigns are cost-effective when compared to traditional marketing methods, they are not cheap. Creating and executing a successful digital campaign requires a significant investment of time, effort, skilled professionals, ongoing monitoring, optimization, and investment in technology and tools. To achieve the desired results, it is imperative that companies allocate adequate resources and budget to their digital campaigns.</p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content clear\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>On the business front, D2C is the new kid on the block and its track record has been phenomenal so far. These companies stand out for their distinctive character and goods, competitive prices, and particular emphasis on online digital marketing and e-commerce.</p>\n<p>Not only this, these brands are upending and disrupting traditional retail patterns with the aim tocompletely revamp how customers shop and bond with brands.</p>\n<p>For instance, some of the emerging D2C&nbsp;<strong>brands such as Mamaearth, CaratLane, and Nua merely took 2 years to reach the INR 100 Crore mark.</strong>&nbsp;This is a classic testament to the resounding success of D2C brands in the Indian market.</p>\n<p>According to an&nbsp;<strong><u>Inc42 report</u></strong>, the D2C statistics are climbing exponentially:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>As of 2021, India has more than 800 D2C startups mushrooming in the country.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>India&rsquo;s direct-to-consumer (D2C) market is likely to reach the whopping size of $100 billion by 2025 and is pulsing with immense promise.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The change is perceptible. The digital platforms have made it easier for businesses to have an active, ongoing relationship with their customers. Brands themselves are opting for direct-to-consumer selling models to stay intimately connected with their audience,defying to serve the middleman and retailers and instead pocket complete control over the sales and distribution process, from manufacturing to shipping and delivery. This enables the company to allocate resources for maximum growth.</p>\n<p>For this reason, D2C has emerged as the firebrand alternative who are</p>\n<p><strong>The rabble- rousers</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The disrupters</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The bunch who likes to paddle their own canoe.</strong></p>\n<p>This may seem like the perfect scenario for the brands but the D2C route comes with its own set of roadblocks and challenges. Unlike regular marketing channels, navigating the D2C space needs careful, honest, and transparent marketing strategies sustain the fragile consumer trust and loyalty. With the market overflowing with options and copies, today&rsquo;s consumer is spoiled with choices. Thus, it is no child&rsquo;s play to ace the D2C model of marketing.</p>\n<p>Here are 4 key steps that the D2C marketers can take to emerge successful in the market:</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1. Find your niche/specialisation. Jack of all trades is the master of none!</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-27025\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Product_specialisation_4fd66dce7d.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Product_specialisation_4fd66dce7d.webp 900w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Product_specialisation_4fd66dce7d-300x133.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Product_specialisation_4fd66dce7d-768x341.webp 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"400\"></figure>\n<p>In a cut-throat market where customers are snowed under multiple options, only unparalleled expertise in your domain can take you to the top of your game and make your startup a cut above the rest. In order to identify this gold mine, it is imperative to identify gaps in the market, find a niche that has high demand but low competition. And then reap your harvest!</p>\n<p>Need proof?</p>\n<p><strong>Mamaearth:</strong>&nbsp;In 2016, the husband and wife duo, Varun Alagh and Ghazal Alagh were searching for safe and toxin-free baby products for their newborn, saw only chemical based options, realised the need for organic and natural alternatives and founded Mamaearth in a moment of both crisis and inspiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Cut to 2023, Mamaearth&rsquo;s career trajectory is scaling new heights.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>Revenue Growth</u></strong><strong>: According to Forbes, Mamaearth&rsquo;s net worth is estimated to be around&nbsp;</strong><strong>$100 million.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>Funding</u></strong><strong>: In April 2021, the brand raised&nbsp;</strong><strong>$50 million&nbsp;</strong><strong>in a Series C funding round, led by Sofina Ventures, Sequoia India, and Elevation Capital.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>Awards and Recognition</u></strong><strong>: Mamaearth has also won awards such as the Economic Times Iconic Brand of India Award,&nbsp;</strong><strong>the Best Start-Up Award&nbsp;</strong><strong>at the ET Innovation Awards, and the Asia&rsquo;s Greatest Brands and Leaders Award.</strong></p>\n<p>This makes it one of the most valuable startups in India.</p>\n<p>Thus, the founders felt the need of something, found it missing in the supermarket aisles, and then became the change they wanted to see in the world&nbsp;<strong>(<em>Gandhi being Gandhi. Relevant as always)</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>In short, they were&nbsp;<strong>mission-focused and idea-first</strong>. Mamaearth recognized a gap in the market for safe, natural, and toxin-free products for babies and young children. The brand launched with a focus on baby care and gradually expanded to include skincare and hair care products for adults as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Build a Strong Brand. Remember that reputation precedes the name!</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-27026\" style=\"width: 624px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ljh.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"284\" height=\"177\"></figure>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Branding is the D2C mindset.</strong></h4>\n<p>It is indispensable to the success of a Direct-to-customer business where the buyer needs to feel a personal bond and identify with the brand fraternity. Hence, the second rule in creating a stellar D2C name is designing a strong label.</p>\n<p>By brand creation, the business playbook means that values, mission, and unique selling proposition (USP) of the business should go viral along with the product on the market grapevine. This happens with building engaging narratives.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t sell a product. Tell a story.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t pitch. Create experience.</em></strong></p>\n<p>And the D2C brand&nbsp;<strong>Licious</strong>&nbsp;did exactly that. It played by the book, chose storytelling and did impeccable branding.</p>\n<p>Licious&rsquo; content strategy is centered around storytelling that emphasizes the quality and freshness of its products.</p>\n<p>Licious&rsquo; website has a section dedicated to its<strong><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Farm to Fork&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;process. It tells the story of how Licious sources its products directly from farmers and fishermen, and ensures that they are processed and delivered fresh to customers. This story emphasizes the brand&rsquo;s commitment to quality and freshness.</p>\n<p>Not just the origin tattlers, Licious also tell&nbsp;<strong>Recipe Stories</strong>.

    "excerpt": "D2C or Ecommerce Market Place",
    "content": "<p><strong>D2C or E-commerce Market Place?</strong></p>\n<p>The debate on #D2C versus #Ecommerce marketplace has been a long-standing one in the marketing circles.</p>\n<p>Some point out how e-commerce marketplaces such as&nbsp;<strong>Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Nykaa</strong>&nbsp;provide the ideal launchpad for baby brands to grow and eventually get their foot in the door.</p>\n<p><strong>On a flip side, according to a study by Shopify, the global D2C market is expected to grow to&nbsp;</strong><strong>$22.4 billion</strong><strong>&nbsp;by 2025.</strong></p>\n<p>Thus, the meteoric success of brands such as&nbsp;<strong>Mamaearth</strong><strong>, Sugar Cosmetics, WOW Skin Science</strong>&nbsp;have made people question if the D2C model is the game-changing plot twist that will make retailers a thing of the past.</p>\n<p>So let us explore the advantages of #Ecommerce giants and the #D2C business model for a comprehensive analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>E-commerce marketplaces have several advantages over D2C business model. Here are a few reasons why they have the edge:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Established trust and reliability:</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-27015\" style=\"width: 812px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/khfdsm-1024x753.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/khfdsm-1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/khfdsm-300x221.jpg 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/khfdsm-768x565.jpg 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/khfdsm.jpg 1300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"753\"></figure>\n<p>Due to their already rooted reputation and legacy in the market, e-commerce giants are considered trustworthy sources for online shopping.</p>\n<p>For instance, as per multiple studies, including<strong>&nbsp;a 2018 survey by&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>Jumpshot</u></strong><strong>, Amazon is majorly responsible for putting newer brands on the map as it generates over&nbsp;60%&nbsp;of online product searches in the US alone.</strong></p>\n<p>This means that when people are looking to buy a product online, they often start their search on Amazon rather than Google. This is likely due to the widespread image of Amazon as a reliable source that offers a wide range of products in its trusted inventory.</p>\n<p>As a consequence, many businesses sell their products on Amazon during the opening years to encash on the legacy and fame of the e-commerce and maximize their online organic visibility through the tie-up.</p>\n<p>Thus, for small emerging businesses,&nbsp;<strong>e-commerce acts as an &lsquo;advertising medium&rsquo; that directly bolsters brand expansion.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Greater customer reach:</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-27016\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/magnet-5589959.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/magnet-5589959.webp 800w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/magnet-5589959-300x179.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/magnet-5589959-768x457.webp 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"476\"></figure>\n<p><strong>According to a survey by&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>Feedvisor</u></strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><strong>89%&nbsp;</strong><strong>of US shoppers have purchased from Amazon in the past year, while only&nbsp;</strong><strong>26%</strong><strong>&nbsp;have purchased from a D2C brand.</strong></p>\n<p>E-commerce marketplaces such as&nbsp;<strong>Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, Meesho</strong>&nbsp;have a much larger customer base than most D2C brands can ever hope to garner.This means that sellers on above platforms have access to a larger audience and traffic that can potentially lead to more brand awareness, sales, and revenue comparatively.</p>\n<p><strong>A report by&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>Accenture</u></strong><strong>&nbsp;found that D2C brands that sell through e-commerce platforms are able to reach a wider audience of consumers and can achieve up to&nbsp;</strong><strong>40%&nbsp;</strong><strong>higher profit margins compared to traditional retail channels.</strong></p>\n<p><em>For example,</em>&nbsp;<em>according to media reports,&nbsp;<strong>WOW Skin Science</strong>&nbsp;has been one of the top-selling brands in its category on Amazon and Flipkart, and the brand&rsquo;s sales have grown significantly since it started selling on e-commerce in 2015.</em></p>\n<p>Apart from this, D2C brands such as Mamaearth, Boat, Wakefit also started their journey by piggybacking on the existing customers of&nbsp;<strong>Nykaa, Amazon</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Flipkart.</strong></p>\n<p>As a result, they gained a loyal following among Indian consumers all thanks to the plethora of reviews available on these platforms that further skyrocketed their sales.</p>\n<p>Similarly,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.happyganga.com/\"><strong><u>Happy Ganga</u></strong></a>&nbsp;is a 100% natural range of probiotic cleaners for floor and dish cleaning that guarantees holistic health with its environment-friendly and river-cleaning composition.</p>\n<p>Whereas&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.leocym.com/\"><strong><u>Leocym</u></strong></a>&nbsp;is an exclusive range of odour neutralizers from France that are now available in India for the first time. Its French formula nips the foul smell at the molecular level rather than temporarily masking it.</p>\n<p>Both Leocym and Happy Ganga are up and coming brands that are showing immense promise in the market.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Lower marketing costs:</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-27017\" style=\"width: 896px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kbhg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\"></figure>\n<p>Since e-commerce marketplaces already have a built-in audience, brands don&rsquo;t have to spend as much money on marketing and advertising to reach potential customers.</p>\n<p>Thus, subscribing to the platform and getting on their bandwagon can be cost-effective for startups that are already functioning on limited funds.</p>\n<p><strong>According to a survey by&nbsp;</strong><strong>Jungle Scout</strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><strong>60%</strong><strong>&nbsp;of Amazon sellers spend less than $5,000 per year on advertising as compared to D2C brands who often have to go the extra mile and spend more to gain traction.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4. Access to customer data:</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-27018\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/6503381.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/6503381.webp 675w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/6503381-300x200.webp 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"675\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p><em>A study by&nbsp;<strong>EY</strong>&nbsp;found that D2C brands that sell through e-commerce platforms are able to collect valuable data on customer behavior and preferences, which can help them fashion their products and marketing tactics in tandem with the customer psychology and their shopping patterns.</em></p>\n<p><strong>According to a survey by&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>Feedvisor</u></strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><strong>70%</strong><strong>&nbsp;of Amazon sellers use data analytics to improve their business, while only&nbsp;</strong><strong>50%</strong><strong>&nbsp;of D2C brands do the same.</strong></p>\n<p>#Ecommerce marketplaces are portals to a wealth of customer data that sellers can study to align their marketing strategies and product offerings. This can include data on customer behaviour, preferences, purchase history, frequently carted items, among other things.</p>\n<p>However, the e-commerce supremacy doesn&rsquo;t imply that there is a one-size-fits all rule. Because the growing trend of #D2C models is clearly disrupting the status quo.</p>\n<p>In size, D2C may be smaller than e-commerce platforms but today,&nbsp;<strong>competition is less about size and more about perception.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And there are several advantages that brands have witnessed by selling via the D2C model. They are as follows:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Incremental Profits:</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-27019\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/personalization-challenges.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/personalization-challenges.webp 826w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/personalization-challenges-300x140.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/personalization-challenges-768x359.webp 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"826\" height=\"386\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>The single biggest reason why D2C brands see larger profit margins than other online sellers is that there is no middleman to eat a pie of their retail price. And it is because of these higher profits, that many D2C brands can afford to price their products cheaper on their own channels than other retailers.</p>\n<p><strong>According to a study by&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a></strong><strong>, D2C brands have an average gross margin that is 10-15% higher than traditional ecommerce brands</strong></p>\n<p>This is because D2C brands can cut out the middleman and keep more of the profits for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Tailor-made Customer Experience</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-27020\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mhjbg.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mhjbg.jpg 820w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mhjbg-300x168.jpg 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mhjbg-768x431.jpg 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"820\" height=\"460\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>With the rich data on their customers otherwise unavailable while selling through a retailer, D2C sellers can build a super-personalized experience for their customers. It becomes all the more crucial, as &nbsp;<strong><em>80%&nbsp;</em></strong><em>of shoppers would instead purchase from brands that offer a higher degree of personalization.</em></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>According to a study by&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>McKinsey</u></strong><strong>, D2C brands have an average customer acquisition cost (CAC) that is&nbsp;</strong><strong>38%</strong><strong>&nbsp;lower than traditional ecommerce brands.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A report by&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>eMarketer</u></strong><strong>&nbsp;found that D2C brands have an average conversion rate that is</strong><strong>&nbsp;2-3x</strong><strong>&nbsp;higher than traditional ecommerce brands.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A report by&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>Yotpo</u></strong><strong>&nbsp;found that D2C brands have an average customer lifetime value (CLTV) that is&nbsp;</strong><strong>23%</strong><strong>&nbsp;higher than traditional ecommerce brands.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these statistics can be attributed to D2C brands building more meaningful relationships with their customers by offering personalized experiences and exceptional customer service.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Higher brand loyalty</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-27021\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/b048-What-is-brand-loyalty-small-1024x658.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/b048-What-is-brand-loyalty-small-1024x658.webp 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/b048-What-is-brand-loyalty-small-300x193.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/b048-What-is-brand-loyalty-small-768x494.webp 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/b048-What-is-brand-loyalty-small.webp 1400w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>As selling directly to the consumer gives brands an upper hand in terms of building customer loyalty as opposed to in wholesale marketplaces, D2C sellers can further capitalize on brand loyalty</p>\n<p><strong>According to a study by&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>Klaviyo</u></strong><strong>, D2C brands have an average email open rate that is&nbsp;</strong><strong>22%&nbsp;</strong><strong>higher than traditional ecommerce brands.</strong></p>\n<p>This is because D2C brands can create more targeted and personalized email campaigns that resonate with their ideal customers.</p>\n<p>Overall, these research statistics suggest that#D2C brands&nbsp; can be more effective than #Ecommerce marketplaces in certain ways, including lower customer acquisition costs, higher customer lifetime values, higher gross margins, higher conversion rates, etc.</p>\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s worth noting that every business is different, and what works for one brand may not work for another. Hence, it is up to the nature, approach, and targeted section of your business that determines whether D2C or e-commerce will allow you to take the lion&rsquo;s share of the spoils home.</p>",

    "excerpt": "Digital campaigns are more about psychology than technology",
    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content clear\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>Word on the grapevine is that&nbsp;<strong><u>Forbes Advisor</u></strong>&nbsp;has dug up some really insightful facts for digital marketers:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>There are about 1.13 billion websites on the internet in 2023.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A new website is built every 3 seconds.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>71% or businesses have a website in 2023</strong></li>\n<li><strong>43% of small businesses are planning to invest in the performance of their website in 2023.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>28% of business is now conducted online, signaling the growing trend of e-commerce and digital marketing.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly, we live in a world filled with numbers and statistics. With such an overwhelming number of websites, social media pages and platforms,&nbsp;<strong>catching attention, manufacturing interest, and retaining customers is becoming a mounting challenge for marketers.</strong></p>\n<p>That said, there is a secret weapon to cut through the noise and hit the bull&rsquo;s eye.</p>\n<p>That secret weapon is the comparatively potent realm of&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>digital psychology.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In the grand scheme of things, digital psychology is a concept, whipped up by combining&nbsp;</strong><strong>digital marketing with behavioral economics and psychology.</strong></p>\n<p>Tools like Google Analytics tracks&nbsp;<strong>WHAT</strong>&nbsp;your customers are up to on the internet. However, digital psychology strives to pick apart the consumer brain, uncover&nbsp;<strong>HOW</strong>&nbsp;people behave online and most importantly, uncover&nbsp;<strong>WHY</strong>&nbsp;they are doing it.</p>\n<p>In essence, digital psychology&rsquo;s role in the digital marketing ecosystem is that of a strategic vision piece that optimizes digital marketing campaigns where raw numbers or technology fall short.</p>\n<p>It aims to identify how you can create a form of online communication and messaging that is persuasive to the unconscious mind, upgrades customer journey so much so that it translates into more actionable conversions.</p>\n<p>Often, consumer behaviour and decision making are centered on&nbsp;<strong>heuristics</strong>&nbsp;that are&nbsp;subconscious decisions&nbsp;and&nbsp;mental shortcuts&nbsp;we rely upon to save our time and effort. Savvy marketers know that tapping into consumer&rsquo;s cognitive biases can help hit the digital gold mine and tip the scales in their favour.</p>\n<p>Thus, the messaging in digital campaigns are designed keeping consumer psychology at the forefront rather than technology.</p>\n<p><strong>5 such digital psychology tactics used in effective marketing are as follows:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Scarcity is the FOMO creator. It&rsquo;s the classic trigger that enables action.</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-27008\" style=\"width: 679px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sss.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sss.png 303w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sss-300x164.png 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"303\" height=\"166\"></figure>\n<p>On social media platforms, everyone wants to be a part of something larger, find emotional points of connection, join a tribe. Hence, the term&nbsp;<strong>FOMO&nbsp;</strong><strong>or &ldquo;</strong><strong>Fear of Missing Out&rdquo;&nbsp;</strong>is a very real concept. It is the fundamental human drive to act like the social animals we are and join a community.</p>\n<p>Digital campaigns like to cash in on this urge by transforming it into&nbsp;<strong>urgency</strong>. This is done by creating illusions of scarcity which in turn triggers and increases consumer&rsquo;s desire to buy so as not to miss out on an opportunity everyone&rsquo;s talking about.</p>\n<p><strong>Digital campaigns create scarcity and urgency in 4 main ways for consumers to get on the bandwagon:</strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>In short supply:</u></strong>&nbsp;<strong>booking.com, fabhotels, and oyo rooms&nbsp;</strong>are genius when it comes to triggering urgency. By using phrases and hook content like&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>final call,&rdquo; &ldquo;only 1 room left,&nbsp;</strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>limited supply,&rdquo; and&nbsp;</strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>only 10 in stock&rdquo; creates a needling sense of urgency</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong><u>For a limited time:</u></strong>&nbsp;<strong>Myntra</strong>&nbsp;plays on the definitive time window theme to get people to shop and swipe cards within 2-3 days. Using phrases like&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>24 hours flash sale&rdquo; and&nbsp;</strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>Sale is LIVE from 28th April &ndash; 30th April&rdquo; gets people scrambling to fill their carts before the product and bumper discounts go out of stock.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>High demand:</u></strong>&nbsp;Compelling taglines and copy such as&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>1437 sold today,&rdquo; &ldquo;On 1400+ Beauty &amp; Personal Care Brands&rdquo; emphasizes popularity&nbsp;</strong>and wide product offerings that increases the likelihood of buying.</p>\n<p>Digital campaigns of e-commerce giants such as&nbsp;<strong>Nykaa and Myntra, Flipkart&nbsp;</strong><strong>include content on their wide customer base to encourage binge shopping.</strong></p>\n<p>Emphasizing<strong>&nbsp;high demand also positions the company as credible, trustworthy, reliable where the majority of the crowd flocks,&nbsp;</strong>enabling the campaign to drive sales by hitting the human need for social proof.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Unique Opportunity:</u></strong>&nbsp;By inserting content like &ldquo;<strong>members only,&nbsp;</strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>early VIP access,&rdquo; or&nbsp;</strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>unique discount code</strong><strong>&rdquo; makes customers feel privileged</strong>&nbsp;to have such offers presented exclusively to them.</p>\n<p>For instance,&nbsp;<strong>Myntra offers early VIP access to&nbsp;</strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>Insiders</strong><strong>&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>who are the top-tier shoppers of the e-commerce.</strong>&nbsp;This psychological tactic utilizes the reward system to prime customers towards purchasing more during the special slots and discounts allotted specially to them by the platform.</p>\n<p>Hence, the traffic increases on this scarcity principle.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The power of Hashtags. Not just for structure, but also for setting the mood/tone of the campaign.</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-27009\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-use-hashtags-on-instagram-617c2865cd135-sej-1024x538.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-use-hashtags-on-instagram-617c2865cd135-sej-1024x538.webp 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-use-hashtags-on-instagram-617c2865cd135-sej-300x158.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-use-hashtags-on-instagram-617c2865cd135-sej-768x403.webp 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-use-hashtags-on-instagram-617c2865cd135-sej-1536x806.webp 1536w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/how-to-use-hashtags-on-instagram-617c2865cd135-sej.webp 1600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\"></figure>\n<p>Using hashtags in digital campaigns are not just for content categorization based on a specific theme so that the user can engage easily with streamlined and related posts.</p>\n<p>It also increases the reach of your content beyond your followers. People searching for or following that particular hashtag can discover your post, build a community or group around a common hashtag.</p>\n<p>It is said that birds of a feather flock together and hashtags confirm this psychological impulse. They work on the psychological principle of uniting you with your tribe, helps with community building, creating a branded hashtag that can help amplify awareness and increase engagement around your campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>Recently, the D2C brand&nbsp;</strong><strong>Chaayos</strong><strong>&nbsp;did a hit campaign on&nbsp;</strong><strong>#AisaBhiHoSaktaHai</strong><strong>&nbsp;to launch their new beverage Chai Frappe that is launched as a unique anomaly in the market.</strong></p>\n<p>To normalize the cross between tea and coffee in their Chai Frappe, Chaayos started the hashtag #AisaBhiHoSaktaHai to set the tone of improbable events actually coming true or being possible of actually materializing in the real world.</p>\n<p><em>This campaign is a psychological conditioning by Chaayos to increase acceptance of their new product in the market by convincing customers that weirder things have happened in the universe before.</em></p>\n<p>For example, their recent creative taglines read:</p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>Jab coffee-lover aur chai-ke shauqeen ka match ho sakta hai, Toh Chaayos Chai Frappe bhi ho sakta hai.</strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>Jab Goa Plan successful ho sakta hai, toh Chaayos Chai Frapp</strong><strong>&eacute;&nbsp;</strong><strong>bhi ho skta hai!&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>The Chaayos campaign is a hit, as the brand has shrewdly collected customer validation for the unique Chai Frappe by asking them to participate in the contest and tell them about their own stories of improbable events coming true in real life.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Social Proof works like a charm in digital campaigns:</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-27010\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oihg-1024x495.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oihg-1024x495.png 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oihg-300x145.png 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oihg-768x371.png 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/oihg.png 1200w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"495\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Studies show that&nbsp;</strong><strong>92%&nbsp;</strong><strong>of online customers read at least one product review before swiping their debit cards, with the majority of shoppers reading between 1-6 reviews before finally making a purchase.</strong></p>\n<p>The fact is, we humans like to follow the crowd and play safe.</p>\n<p>By inserting positive reviews, happy customer stories and feedbacks, messages, etc visiting customers are more willing to buy the product that they assume is already tried and tested.</p>\n<p>There are a number of ways, this badge of social proof can be included in digital campaigns to make it a resounding success:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>customer reviews</strong></li>\n<li><strong>total subscribers/ followers</strong></li>\n<li><strong>total number of shares, searches, etc</strong></li>\n<li><strong>success stories by customers</strong></li>\n<li><strong>client, investor logos</strong></li>\n<li><strong>third- party certifications</strong></li>\n<li><strong>security badges</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A clear example of this psychological tactic has been used by the up and coming D2C brand&nbsp;<strong><u>Bewakoof&nbsp;</u></strong>in their marketing strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>On the company&rsquo;s 11th birthday, they announced the big news of Aditya Birla&rsquo;s TMRV investing INR 200 crores in Bewakoof.com in the form of a validation post on Instagram.</strong></p>\n<p>They inserted a news clipping in their post to amplify their achievement and the recognition Bewakoof.com has been receiving from industry giants.</p>\n<p>This is because authority figures, association with big brands provide another type of social proof for customers, making them more inclined to try out newer names in the market.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Loss Aversion Bias is real in customers.</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-27011\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/what-is-the-loss-aversion-bias-1024x715-1.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/what-is-the-loss-aversion-bias-1024x715-1.webp 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/what-is-the-loss-aversion-bias-1024x715-1-300x209.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/what-is-the-loss-aversion-bias-1024x715-1-768x536.webp 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"715\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>Loss aversion bias refers to the human tendency to avoid losses at all costs and strive to make profits or equivalent gains.</p>\n<p><strong>In simpler words, the fear of losing or paying more far outweighs the pleasure of winning or buying something at a cheaper price.</strong></p>\n<p>Therefore, marketers harness this psychological phenomenon in the way they position their digital campaigns. For example, phrases like&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;F</strong><strong>lat 200 off for new customers,&rdquo; &ldquo;up to 80% off,&rdquo; and&nbsp;</strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong>1+1 free&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;successfully grab customer&rsquo;s attention.</p>\n<p>Not only this,&nbsp;<strong>coupon codes work as a major incentive for shoppers who are looking to cart items on a budget.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, online shopping giant&nbsp;<strong>AJIO</strong>&nbsp;goes the extra mile to highlight its numbers during the mega sales.</p>\n<p>It successfully uses numbers to grab eyeballs and create sensational hype about mega extensive savings and discounts:</p>\n<p><strong>AJIO ALL STARS SALE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>50-90% OFF | 5000+ Brands | 1.2 Million Style</strong></p>\n<p><em>Such quantified content and taglines create the mental image of thrift shopping for customers who are attracted to the idea of savings and want to avoid paying the full price at all costs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>5. Reels and videos are the way to preach! Visual Aids help in sustaining customer focus.</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-27012\" style=\"width: 850px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jknhgj.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jknhgj.jpg 612w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jknhgj-300x150.jpg 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"612\" height=\"307\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Creative concept. Creator. Visual contents.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><strong><u>Forbes Advisor</u></strong>&nbsp;noticed the following pattern in consumer behavior:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Including videos on a website can increase time spent on page by&nbsp;</strong><strong>88%</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The average time spent on pages with videos is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>6 minutes.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>&nbsp;Whereas website users spend an average of&nbsp;</strong><strong>5.59 seconds&nbsp;</strong><strong>looking at written content on a page.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hence, there&rsquo;s a considerable uptick in the use of reels and capsule sized videos in the working plan of digital campaigns. This is a medium that gets more viewership and clicks as opposed to written content.</p>\n<p><strong>For instance,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Mamaearth</strong><strong>&nbsp;recently started a&nbsp;</strong><strong>#GoodnessMakesYouBeautiful</strong><strong>&nbsp;campaign on which it posted multiple videos of common people doing uncommon acts of goodness. The video medium helped create a pastiche of narratives that brought ordinary people to the limelight, making the campaign viral.</strong></p>\n<p>In a nutshell, by understanding consumer psychology, marketers can predict and influence consumers&rsquo; behaviour through their digital marketing strategies. Pair consumer psychology with digital marketing and there you have it- digital psychology. The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow!</p>\n</div>",

Moreover, technology keeps changing and can only function in the capacity of a mere springboard or platform to showcase your produce to the world.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, one cannot bait the audience without optimizing customer experience in a fashion that floors them even in the age of&nbsp;<strong>information overload&nbsp;</strong>when the user&rsquo;s focus shrivels in the face of a thousand distractions.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Yep people, digital audience are hard nuts to crack!</em></strong></p>\n<p>So what is the key to corner your market? What is the secret sauce?</p>\n<p>Most importantly, what&rsquo;s the mantra to make digital campaigns change the narrative in your favour?</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Optimizing user experience. Keep their comfort your top priority!</strong></h5>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-27001\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/user-experience-optimization-Blog_header1-1024x430.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/user-experience-optimization-Blog_header1-1024x430.webp 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/user-experience-optimization-Blog_header1-300x126.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/user-experience-optimization-Blog_header1-768x323.webp 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/user-experience-optimization-Blog_header1-1536x645.webp 1536w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"430\"></figure>\n<p>The answer lies in<strong>&nbsp;hacking and decoding the psychology</strong>&nbsp;of your prospective customers!</p>\n<p>For this reason, there&rsquo;s been an overt shift towards&nbsp;<strong>mobile-first strategies.</strong>&nbsp;As mobile devices continue to dominate internet usage, businesses are increasingly adopting mobile-first strategies to ensure digital marketing efforts are optimized for mobile and mobile applications offer seamless customer experience.</p>\n<p>To further make operations minimalistic, introduction of voice search such as Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa has cranked up the user comfort by several notches. With the increasing use of&nbsp;<strong>smart speakers and voice assistants, voice search</strong>&nbsp;is becoming an important area of focus for digital marketers.</p>\n<p>Today&rsquo;s social e-commerce platforms such as Pinterest, Instagram, Facebooks know how the regular digital native thinks when he/she is out on their daily retail tour. Marketers understand the psychological factors that influence user behaviour such as usability, navigation, and visual design to optimize the user experience and drive conversions.</p>\n<p>That is why video and visual content are becoming increasingly popular in digital marketing, with short-form videos, live streaming, and interactive content all gaining traction to upgrade the user comfort level by leaps.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>pins</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>reels</strong>, the sudden upsurge in&nbsp;<strong>video content&nbsp;</strong>marketing is indicative of current digital marketing models leveraging on the short attention span of the average social media user.</li>\n<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Youtube shorts</strong>&nbsp;are deliberately curated as capsule size videos for quick consumption and have become a huge hit amongst users due to their rhythmic and fluid design structure. The whirpool structure of Youtube shorts is so arresting that people end up addicted to scrolling, unconsciously getting sucked into the vast ocean of news and data for hours at a stretch.</li>\n<li>Due to the influx of consumable bite-sized unfiltered content online, the phenomenon called&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;DOOMSCROLLING&rdquo; or &ldquo;DOOMSURFING&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;has become a real issue where people are constantly fed bad news and events due to uncontrollable scrolling over and over again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apart from this,&nbsp;<strong>podcasts and audiobooks</strong>&nbsp;have become a popular way for people to consume audio content. Their portability and convenience of consumption has added to their preference appeal. Since this form of content can be clubbed in with other activities such as working out or running on a treadmill, an&nbsp;<strong>estimated 104 million people in the US alone are listening to podcasts regularly&nbsp;</strong><strong>due to their viable packaging design.</strong></p>\n<p>Hence, understanding the psychology of how people interact with digital interfaces certainly gives the edge to create a more intuitive and engaging user experience.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Building trust and credibility. Loyalty and Fraternity never gets old!</strong></h5>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-27003\" style=\"width: 720px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/imagess.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/imagess.png 310w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/imagess-300x158.png 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"310\" height=\"163\"></figure>\n<p>The rise of&nbsp;<strong>Influencer Marketing</strong>&nbsp;is one of the most prominent developments in recent digital marketing trends.</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;<strong>2023 study by&nbsp;</strong><strong>Deloitte on Digital Media trends</strong>&nbsp;testified to the power and effectiveness of labels cashing in on this aspect of human psychology to drive successful campaigns.</p>\n<p>Influencer marketing has emerged as a powerful tool for reaching younger audiences and building brand awareness, with businesses partnering with social media influencers to promote their products and services.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact,&nbsp;<strong>content creators and influencers on instagram can establish and build trust, grow communities, and drive awareness</strong>&nbsp;and excitement for brands, products, and content. Notably, the trust that creators accrue can transfer to the brands they represent.</p>\n<p><strong>Nearly half of consumers say that if an online creator they trust has reviewed a brand&rsquo;s product, they are more likely to trust that brand.</strong></p>\n<p>These sentiments are especially strong for<strong><u>&nbsp;Gen Zs and Millennials</u></strong>, showing the importance of brand-creator partnerships for reaching and building relationships with these youngest cohorts so used to socializing online.</p>\n<p><strong><u>The 2023 Deloitte report</u></strong><strong>&nbsp;states that around&nbsp;</strong><strong>40%&nbsp;</strong><strong>of those in these generations are more influenced by being part of community of followers of a creator or brand than by reviews on a shopping site.</strong></p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

In the digital age, businesses have become more streamlined in their courtship ritual, aiming to provide singular attention and services to their customer base.</p>\n<p>For instance, increased use of&nbsp;<strong>artificial intelligence and machine learning</strong>&nbsp;is being generously added in digital marketing plans to improve targeting and personalization, automate processes, and optimize campaigns.</p>\n<p>After the towering success of Microsoft&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>ChatGPT</strong>, Google launched&nbsp;<strong>Bard</strong>&nbsp;having recognized the humungous potential of AI in terms of personalized and&nbsp;<strong>interactive digital chatbots</strong>&nbsp;doling out fast-paced solutions to incoming queries and service requests.</p>\n<p>Not only this, the&nbsp;<strong><u>2023 Deloitte report</u></strong>&nbsp;had an interesting insight regarding the consumption behaviour of&nbsp;<strong>User-generated content (UGC)</strong>&nbsp;by millennials.</p>\n<p>It found that half of Gen Zs and Millennials prefer user-generated video feeds to streaming video services: &ldquo;<strong><em>Unlike TV, they deliver endless streams of shorter, user-generated videos that are personalized, interactive, and social, at no cost.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>\n<p>Across all generations, a majority say they watch user-generated videos because they are free to watch, videos they see are about topics they&rsquo;re interested in, they&rsquo;re convenient to watch, and there&rsquo;s always something new.</p>\n<p>Hence, there&rsquo;s been ample proof that catering to the human psychology of users by providing tailored content has been received with exceptional response.</p>\n<p>In summary, marketers must unpack the mental factors that reinforce trust and credibility, such as social proof, authority, consistency, and use them to build intimate relationships with their audience. Because digital campaigns that are designed without any psychological backing seldom hit the bull&rsquo;s eye. While technology is an essential component of digital campaigns, it is the understanding and application of psychology that ultimately dictates success.</p>\n</div>",

    "excerpt": "Four Key Essential Concerns of a Chief Digital Officer",
    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content clear\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<p>The proverb, &ldquo;Knowledge is power&rdquo; is very much the driving fuel of the entire corporate sector that is rigged to thrive on data pooling in from all sides. In such a scenario, when data is the operative word, organizations depend largely on professionals who have the knack to play around with tricky data.</p>\n<p>As a result, the trendiest C-suite role for the past few years has been that of the Chief Digital Officer, or the CDO. The number of CDOs has grown from a few hundred eight years ago to tens of thousands today.</p>\n<p><strong>As a matter of fact, research from PwC suggests&nbsp;</strong><strong>21%</strong><strong>&nbsp;of large public firms now have a CDO.</strong></p>\n<p>Why is that?</p>\n<p>This is because the&nbsp;<strong>Chief Digital Officer (CDO)</strong>&nbsp;brings a kaleidoscope of skill sets and perspectives to the table when the conversation is digital.</p>\n<p>Their esoteric know-how is essential for success in a business environment that dances to the rhythm of a&nbsp;<em>digital-driven regime.</em></p>\n<p>Chief Digital Officers are given a digital mandate that has all the business objectives at the same time. So right from the ROI on the overall investment that the CDO needs to ensure, they are also tasked with taking care of the online brand management in the same digital budget that has been allocated to them while keeping a keen eye at the reputation side online.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, CDOs have their fingers in every pie as they really need to ascertain if digital mediums can be used as extensions for service portfolio or if they can be leveraged to add to the convenience of the target segment.</p>\n<p>As Chief Digital Officer (CDO) are entrusted with the responsibility of driving digital initiatives and achieving business objectives in the digital realm, from strategy to the real side of implementation. This task requires a clear understanding of the evolving marketing landscape and the ability to navigate through technical or the techno functional concepts of SEO, SMO or content curation, creation, segregation and other jargons can prove to be a bit challenging.</p>\n<p>For instance, PPC is there, remarketing is there on top of search engine marketing. Also, there are budgets to be allocated for organic and inorganic. The team is to be built. The Key Result Areas (KRAS) are to be set. And not to forget, there are competitors to watch out for. Whether a CDO is working with jargons or on multiple teams, whether in B2B or B2C, the deliverables have to be met hitting all the cylinders in all the areas alike.</p>\n<p>However, in order to simplify the tortuous journey of a Chief Digital Officer, here are the four key essential that can help them cut through the noise and become the Jack of all digital trades:</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. C-Suite Framework:</strong></h5>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-26995\" style=\"width: 1042px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/img11.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/img11.webp 480w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/img11-300x169.webp 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"></figure>\n<p>Establishing a solid C-suite framework is crucial for a successful digital transformation. This framework aligns the organization&rsquo;s business objectives with its concomitant technology implementation.</p>\n<p>The business pyramid consists of three layers:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The Business layer</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The Functional layer, and</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The Operational layer.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>C suite framework ensures that the business layer is intact, supported by the functional layer and then complemented by a larger bottom of that pyramid of organization as operational layer.&nbsp;</strong>Hence, by ensuring a strong C-suite framework, a Chief Digital Officer can lay the foundation for effective digital strategies.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Strategy to Implementation (S2I) Documentation:</strong></h5>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-26996\" style=\"width: 693px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/images.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\"></figure>\n<p>To meet the challenges of digital transformation, lead the team, and orchestrate the process, the highly resourceful position of Chief Digital Officer was created.

For instance, India to Sweden, Philippines to UK, etc.</strong></p>\n<p>Simply speaking, offshoring digital marketing is a company&rsquo;s way of getting big bang for their buck.</p>\n<p>And that is why offshoring digital marketing activities has seen significant growth over the past decade. Many companies have turned to offshore destinations to reduce costs and gain access to skilled professionals in areas like search engine optimisation (SEO), content marketing, social media management, and more.</p>\n<p>However, it must be noted that navigating the intricate maze of global delivery models is already a highly complex enigma. Now add outsourcing and an offshoring component to the equation and the difficulty level shoots by several notches. What one finds is an even bigger challenge that demands thoughtful changes in the working ways.</p>\n<p><strong>To add fuel to fire, translation becomes a major hiccup as language barriers and cultural differences have willing companies tongue-tied and grappling with uncertainties.</strong></p>\n<p>On a flip side, if wisely executed, offshoring can pave the path for organisations to remain competitive, strengthen their hold in the digital market, and work smart so that they can focus on their niche area of expertise while delegating work to specialised digital service providers for best results.</p>\n<p><em>When well executed, an effective offshoring arrangement can forge a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship that can last for many years to come.</em></p>\n<p>Below are 5 essential ways to avoid pitfalls while offshoring digital marketing services from a third party supplier.</p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>&nbsp;1. Test the waters and explore your options.</strong></h5>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-26987\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/b12a.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/b12a.png 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/b12a-300x140.png 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/b12a-768x359.png 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"478\"></figure>\n<p><strong>This means:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Determine the scope of what kinds of digital services will be outsourced.</li>\n<li>Examine outsourcing options and agree strategy</li>\n<li>Develop highly specialised operating model, business case, and governance wing.</li>\n<li>Map out implementation and key considerations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>As per Tholons Top 50 Digital Nations and A.T. Kearney Global Services Location Index of 2019,&nbsp;<u>India remains the leading outsourcing preference.</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>India also has 14 super cities listed in the Tholons report.</strong></p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Prepare Carefully.</strong></h5>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-26988\" style=\"width: 1054px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/b12b.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/b12b.webp 630w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/b12b-300x157.webp 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"330\"></figure>\n<p>Offshoring for digital marketing is process centric and location agnostic.</p>\n<p>In the report titled, &ldquo;Offshoring-how to ensure success,&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>Deloitte</strong>&nbsp;asked five vendors active in the Swedish market about their grassroot experiences and point of view of what homework organisations considering offshoring delivery should do.</p>\n<p>The interviewed vendors recommended a number of key activities to be carried out before entering into an offshoring engagement:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Define a strategy including goals and objectives</li>\n<li>Define areas that set the scope and guidelines for offshoring- Core (business critical) and Non-Core (non-business critical)</li>\n<li>KPI&rsquo;s should be clearly pronounced both for smooth transition and steady state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Who does it from where, is not as important as what and how and the ability to measure the outcome. This is a cultural change and needs to be addressed before offshoring begins&rdquo; as one of the Indian headquartered vendors express it.</em></p>\n<p>According to&nbsp;<strong>Deloitte&rsquo;s 2016 Global Outsourcing Survey</strong>,&nbsp;spending on outsourced services in the global market has almost doubled over the last two decades, from $45.6 billion in 2000 to the US $86.6 billion in 2018.</p>\n<p>And it keeps on increasing. Now around 78% of businesses worldwide feel positive about their relationship with their outsourcing company.</p>\n<p><strong>As a result,&nbsp;</strong><strong>57%&nbsp;</strong><strong>of US companies have increased their use of outsourcing.</strong></p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Evaluate. Get to know the vendors.</strong></h5>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-26989\" style=\"width: 941px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2209976.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2209976.webp 663w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2209976-300x204.webp 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"663\" height=\"450\"></figure>\n<p>At this stage, it is better to closely study your choice of a vendor.</p>\n<p>Organisations considering offshoring should visit the delivery centers to get a feel of the offshore service provider.</p>\n<p><strong>It is wise to see them in action so that the&nbsp;<u>vendor can be properly audited on various parameters like working standards, specialisations, previous track record, compensation, and adherence to local laws</u>.</strong></p>\n<p>It is also a golden chance to establish report and build organic relationships as well as learn about the culture and work bandwidths of the digital service providers.</p>\n<p><strong>According to reports by NASSCOM, the IT and BPO industry in India has amassed a whopping revenue of&nbsp;</strong><strong>$154 billion&nbsp;</strong><strong>in the year 2019.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Over the next five years,&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>40%&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>of India&rsquo;s workforce is expected to augment their skills in order to meet the requirements of outsourcers.</em></strong></p>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.

In the context of offshoring, a transition can mean the passing of the baton, the smooth transfer of services from a legacy organisation to a vendor organisation in accordance with contractual requirements.</em></p>\n<p>In order for a smooth sailing in the transition management process, it is advised:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Clients set up a strong Program Management Office with representation from both the parties.</li>\n<li>Requirements should be outlined and fulfilled, risks and potential issues should be identified and addressed.</li>\n<li>Put up effective reporting mechanisms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Optimise.</strong></h5>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-26991\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dgsg-1024x614.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dgsg-1024x614.webp 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dgsg-300x180.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dgsg-768x461.webp 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dgsg.webp 1300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"614\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p><em>Ensure the offshoring operation is a well-oiled machine.</em></p>\n<p>After the transition phase is over, the service enters into the operational mode and work picks up. At this stage, roles and responsibilities become highly visible and prominent. This can be achieved in the following ways:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Conduct post transition review to assess the achievements of digital objectives.</li>\n<li>Ongoing programme management of supplier transformation activities.</li>\n<li>Manage post contract transition to new pricing models or Service Level Agreements (SLA&rsquo;s)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While finances can be a strong motive to forge an offshoring arrangement, vendor-client experiences have shown that singular obsession with cost-reduction should not be the primary objective. In fact, to get the best of an offshoring alliance, the vendor must be measured on areas like customer satisfaction, superlative operational efficiency, the whole gamut of digital expertise, among many other things.</p>\n<p>Thus, while navigating the offshoring landscape can require you to sidestep potential landmines so that you narrow down your search to the ideal service provider who carries out your digital marketing with utmost finesse, the search can be worth your time if you take proper steps and precautions to establish and communicate your digital objectives and expectations.</p>\n<p>All the best!</p>\n</div>",

Apple&rsquo;s ability to launch new iPhone models quickly has helped it establish a competitive edge and generate significant buzz around its products.&nbsp;<strong>By minimizing TTM, Apple capitalizes on consumer excitement, drives pre-orders, and creates a sense of exclusivity.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For example, the iPhone 15 model will likely release in September, 2023 and the anticipation has started building among Apple fans. The rumour mills are already running and there&rsquo;s so much conjecture around the new model such as:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Will the iPhone 15 have a USB-C port?</em></p>\n<p><em>Will Apple increase iPhone15 prices in 2023?</em></p>\n<p><em>How many model will iPhone15 have?</em></p>\n<p><em>Will the iPhone 15 get optimized for the Vision Pro headset?</em></p>\n<p><em>Will it even be called the &ldquo;iPhone 15&rdquo;?</em></p>\n<p>All this hype as well as the speed and efficiency with which Apple launches its products works to the advantage of the brand as their latest handsets are priced at a whopping sum that is infamous to cost people an arm and a leg.</p>\n<p>Not only this,&nbsp;<strong>fast fashion brands such as Zara and H&amp;M</strong>&nbsp;have also mastered the art of rapid TTM to support their GTM strategies. They continually<strong>&nbsp;monitor fashion trends and respond quickly by designing, manufacturing, and delivering new clothing collections to their stores in a matter of weeks.</strong></p>\n<p>For example,&nbsp;<strong>Zara&rsquo;s latest Spring 2023 Studio collection</strong>, with campaign images shot by Steven Meisel, is full of balletcore-inspired details and maxi skirts, which have become one of the year&rsquo;s most sought-after items.&nbsp;The collection additionally has an assortment of bags and shoes, from wooden platforms to studded shoulder bags that are a huge hit in the market.</p>\n<p>Thus, shortening its TTM, Zara&rsquo;s campaigns and collection stay ahead of its competitors, meet consumer demands for the latest fashion, and drive impulse purchases for the brand.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-26978\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Time-to-Market_BciaXqD-1024x576.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Time-to-Market_BciaXqD-1024x576.png 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Time-to-Market_BciaXqD-300x169.png 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Time-to-Market_BciaXqD-768x432.png 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Time-to-Market_BciaXqD-1536x864.png 1536w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Time-to-Market_BciaXqD.png 1920w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\"></figure>\n<p>On the other hand, a longer TTM can result in&nbsp;missed market opportunities, increased competition, and potential loss of customer interest.&nbsp;If a company takes too long to bring a product or service to market, competitors may launch similar offerings first, gaining a competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, prolonged development cycles can lead to delays in generating revenue and put a strain on the company&rsquo;s resources.</p>\n<p><strong><u>The fate of Nokia</u>&nbsp;shows what damages a prolonged TTM is capable of.</strong></p>\n<p>Nokia was once a dominant player in the mobile phone market. However, the company&rsquo;s slow response to the emergence of smartphones resulted in a prolonged TTM for their competitive offerings.</p>\n<p><strong>While Nokia focused on improving feature phones, competitors like Apple and Samsung quickly launched smartphones that revolutionized the industry. Nokia&rsquo;s delayed entry into the smartphone market led to a loss of market share and significantly impacted their overall business.</strong></p>\n<p>Similarly, BlackBerry, a prominent player in the early smartphone market, spiralled downhill due to its delayed response to the rising popularity of touchscreen phones.</p>\n<p>So what went wrong with Blackberry that it was edged out of the market?</p>\n<p><strong><u>BlackBerry</u></strong><strong>&nbsp;met its end because its sole focus was on physical keyboard-equipped devices while competitors such as Apple and Android-based manufacturers started rolling out touchscreen smartphones that gained significant market traction.</strong></p>\n<p>BlackBerry&rsquo;s extended TTM in delivering competitive touchscreen devices led to a loss of market share and impacted their position in the industry.</p>\n<p>Therefore, minimizing the TTM is a key objective for many companies, as it directly impacts their GTM strategy and the success of their products or services in the market. It requires efficient product development processes, streamlined decision-making, effective project management, and cross-functional collaboration within the organization.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, when TTM takes up less space, that gives companies a proactive start, tipping the scales in their favour by giving GTM time to keep its end of the bargain.</p>\n</div>",

This means that values, mission, and unique selling proposition (USP) of the D2C business should go viral along with the product on the market grapevine. This happens with building engaging narratives.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t sell a product. Tell a story.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Don&rsquo;t pitch.

So when they talk up a product or display an ad to their millions of followers, sales are bound to result.</p>\n<p>This is why companies reach out to influencers individually and offer them free products or services so they can give an authentic endorsement in the form of:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Content for their blog and social media platforms.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Interview of a company leader to feature in a podcast or video.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Inquire about paid endorsements</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although major influencers will be a pipe dream for small businesses, but niche influencers may be affordable for their C2B marketing needs.</p>\n<p><strong>The Importance of Tailored Approaches:</strong></p>\n<p>While the aforementioned business models represent distinct approaches, it&rsquo;s crucial to recognize that no single plan can fit all scenarios. Every industry, market segment, and customer base has unique characteristics, preferences, and demands.</p>\n<p><strong>Attempting to implement a one-size-fits-all strategy can lead to missed opportunities, ineffective marketing, and a failure to meet customer expectations.</strong></p>\n<p>By understanding the specific requirements of each business model, companies can craft targeted strategies that resonate with their intended audience.</p>\n<p><strong>A&nbsp;<u>tailored approach</u>&nbsp;allows businesses to leverage the strengths of a particular model, adapt to changing market dynamics, and deliver personalized experiences that drive customer loyalty and revenue growth.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Adapting to the Evolving Landscape:</strong></p>\n<p>The business landscape is continually evolving, and new models are emerging as technology advances and consumer behaviour changes. Companies need to remain agile and adaptable, continuously evaluating the suitability of their chosen business model and exploring new opportunities as they arise.</p>\n<p><strong>Moreover,&nbsp;<u>hybrid models</u>&nbsp;that combine elements from different approaches are gaining popularity.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, many traditional B2B companies are incorporating D2C strategies to reach consumers directly and diversify their revenue streams.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>When trading circles are inundated with diverse business models such as B2B, B2C, D2C, B2G, C2C, and C2B, it is essential to recognize that each model requires a unique approach. Businesses must carefully consider their target audience, industry dynamics, and market demands to tailor their strategies accordingly. A successful business is one that can adapt to the ever-changing landscape, explore new models when appropriate, and&nbsp;leverage the strengths of each approach to create a winning formula.</p>\n<p>Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all plan, but there is always an opportunity for innovation and growth when you understand and embrace the nuances of your chosen business model.</p>\n<p>So learn to mix and match well!</p>\n</div>",

Create the impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Clearly, not having a game plan might end up diluting your marketing efforts!</strong></p>\n<p>But why is strategy so important?</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding the Strategic Perspective:</strong></h6>\n<p>Digital performance marketing focuses on maximizing measurable results and return on investment (ROI) by leveraging various online channels and techniques.</p>\n<p>It encompasses a range of activities such as search engine optimization (SEO), social media marketing, email marketing, and more.</p>\n<p>Often, marketers get caught up in the tactical aspects of these activities, such as optimizing keywords, creating compelling ad copies, or running A/B tests.</p>\n<p>While the tactical execution of digital campaigns is crucial, it is equally important to bolster your marketing moves with a strategic plan.</p>\n<p><em>Otherwise, your whole digital campaign can come crumbling down like a house of cards.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Below are marketing activities that relate to the 5Ds that should be reviewed as part of a strategic approach to digital marketing are:</strong></p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Digital Goals</strong></h6>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-26963\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8a-1024x539.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8a-1024x539.png 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8a-300x158.png 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8a-768x404.png 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8a.png 1520w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"539\"></figure>\n<p>This essentially translates into&nbsp;defining clear and measurable goals for your digital performance marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p>These goals should align with your overall business objectives and be&nbsp;<strong>specific, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.</strong></p>\n<p>This can be done by curating a&nbsp;manifestation plan, complete with themes and hashtag bank. This is like a lighthouse that directs the course, tone, and market positioning of your campaign.</p>\n<p>Not only this, putting together a&nbsp;<strong>Social Media Calendar</strong>&nbsp;also helps marketers find the head and tail of the ongoing campaign. It helps keep a&nbsp;<strong><em>track of social media assets, type of content and the frequency with which they are being uploaded, important dates and days of posting, etc.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Having well-defined goals will guide your strategies and help you measure your success accurately.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Digital audiences</strong>:</h6>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-26964\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8b-1024x559.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8b-1024x559.webp 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8b-300x164.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8b-768x419.webp 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8b-1536x838.webp 1536w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8b.webp 1540w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"559\"></figure>\n<p>Take the time to thoroughly understand your target audience, their needs, preferences, and online behaviors.</p>\n<p>Conduct market research, analyze customer data, and develop buyer personas to create highly targeted and personalized campaigns.</p>\n<p><strong>A study by Hubspot revealed that 30% of the marketers who participated in it used market segmentation techniques to improve email engagement.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Segmented campaigns had 14.31% higher open rates and saw 101% more clicks than non-segmented campaigns.</em></p>\n<p>Thus, tailoring your messaging and content to resonate with your audience surely helps grab more eyeballs.</p>\n<p>Coca-Cola&rsquo;s &ldquo;Share a Coke&rdquo;&nbsp;campaign also went by this principle.</p>\n<p><strong>The strategic perspective behind this campaign was to personalize the Coca-Cola experience and strengthen the emotional connection with consumers. By printing popular names on their bottles, Coca-Cola aimed to create a sense of personalization and encourage social sharing.</strong></p>\n<p>Airbnb&rsquo;s localization strategy&nbsp;also testifies to the concept of niche marketing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Airbnb&rsquo;s success can be attributed, in part, to its strategic localization efforts in different markets.&nbsp;Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, Airbnb tailors its digital performance marketing strategies to meet the unique needs of each local market.</p>\n<p><strong>They invest in localized content, translations, and targeted advertising to resonate with specific cultural nuances and preferences.</strong></p>\n<p>This strategic perspective allows Airbnb to connect with their target audience effectively, build trust, and drive user adoption in diverse markets worldwide.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

Since this form of content can be effortlessly heard on smart speakers, an&nbsp;<strong>estimated 104 million people in the US alone are listening to podcasts regularly&nbsp;</strong><strong>due to their viable packaging medium.</strong></p>\n<p><em>An insightful poll from the&nbsp;<u>American Audiobook Publishers Association</u>&nbsp;found that 60% of respondents own a smart speaker such as Amazon Echo, Google Home or Apple HomePod, and 46% of smart speaker owners have used it to listen to an audiobook, which is up&nbsp;</em><strong><em>31%&nbsp;</em></strong><em>from 2020.</em></p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Digital Media &amp; Channels:</strong></h6>\n<p>A 360-degree digital performance marketing strategy should include various aspects, including&nbsp;search engine optimization (SEO), paid advertising, content marketing, social media, email marketing, and more.</p>\n<p>Each channel needs synergistically work to create a cohesive customer journey and maximize the Return of Investment (ROI).</p>\n<p>For this purpose, the armada of&nbsp;<strong><u>content and social media assets can be repurposed</u></strong>&nbsp;depending on the communication channel in question.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Nike&rsquo;s iconic &ldquo;Just Do It&rdquo; campaign</u></strong>&nbsp;did exactly that. It did not put all its eggs in one basket and left no channel unturned to market its product.</p>\n<p>The campaign&rsquo;s focus was not solely on promoting Nike&rsquo;s products but on inspiring and empowering individuals to embrace an active lifestyle. To trumpet this message proactively, Nike went the extra mile and used a cocktail of channels to convince people in favour of their athletic cause.</p>\n<p><strong>Not out of sight, not out of mind!</strong></p>\n<p><strong>By leveraging digital channels, Nike created compelling content and storytelling that resonated with their target audience. They utilized&nbsp;<u>social media, influencer marketing, and user-generated content to amplify the campaign&rsquo;s reach and engage their customers.</u></strong></p>\n<p>And the tactic worked!</p>\n<p>The campaign was so successful in its approach that till this day, Nike is synonymous with the tagline &ndash; &ldquo;Just do it!&rdquo; Thanks to multiple channels chanting the same message, the catchphrase has been indoctrinated into the subconscious of the consumers.</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Digital Data:</strong></h6>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-26966\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8d-1024x750.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8d-1024x750.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8d-300x220.jpg 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8d-768x563.jpg 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b8d.jpg 1500w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"750\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>This game-plan relies heavily on data and analytics to predict the customer&rsquo;s next move.

Instead questions are verbally spelled out and responses are expected in no time.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s true. More and more people are switching over to voice searches instead of typing out their queries.</p>\n<p>Ever wondered why the change of heart?</p>\n<p>Not one but three major factors are the root cause of this new trend:</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Voice search moves more quickly than typing.</strong></h6>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-26957\" style=\"width: 859px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b7a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"299\" height=\"168\"></figure>\n<p>Here, speed takes the cake home, pushing written searches to the back burner.</p>\n<p>It is found that voice searches produce faster results than typing, tipping the scales in the favour of the former.</p>\n<p><strong><em>According to a&nbsp;<u>Backlinko</u>&nbsp;research, a voice search loads a results page in 4.6 seconds, but a typical written search takes 8.8 seconds.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>That&rsquo;s almost half the time taken.</em></p>\n<p>Not only this, typing gets tedious especially when you&rsquo;ve got a lot on your plate and&nbsp;things need to be done quickly and on large scale.</p>\n<p>Thus, in case of a screaming to-do list, voice search comes as a handy tool that gets more done in less time.</p>\n<p><em>For instance, if you are making a playlist of your favorite songs then instead of typing the details and lyrics of each song, it would be a much viable and convenient way to speak out the song using devices such as Alexa.</em></p>\n<p><strong>As a matter of fact, according to&nbsp;<u>Oberlo</u>, the top activities carried out using voice assistants are playing music (74%), checking the weather (66%), and setting alarms and reminders (58%).</strong></p>\n<p>Similarly, this approach can be adopted for&nbsp;shopping online on e-commerce&nbsp;platforms. By&nbsp;using voice search, you can comb the internet for products that you specifically need in no time.</p>\n<p><strong>Plus, you don&rsquo;t typically need to pick up the gadget in your hands to converse on them.</strong></p>\n<p>Spatial proximity is not a necessity in voice search. You can pose your question to the blank wall, and answers will pop out of thin air.</p>\n<p>That is why customers feel more at ease thanks to&nbsp;<strong>the touchless feature of voice search</strong>&nbsp;than they would with more traditional internet search alternatives.</p>\n<p><em>Because it&rsquo;s like talking to your own personal genie!</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>For example, voice search tools are especially helpful if you are driving since you may make purchases before you get at your location. While driving, you may effortlessly place orders without even using your hands.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Therefore,&nbsp;voice search is undoubtedly more practical since it enables multitasking, especially when individuals are engaged in other tasks and unable to completely utilize their hands.</p>\n<p>A classic case of two birds with one stone!</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2.&nbsp;<strong>Voice assistant replies have significantly improved since its inception:</strong></h6>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-26958\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b7b-1024x538.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b7b-1024x538.webp 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b7b-300x158.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b7b-768x403.webp 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b7b-1536x806.webp 1536w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b7b.webp 1600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"538\"></figure>\n<p><em>According to PwC, more than 93% of users are happy with the precision and responsiveness of their voice assistants as a result of the advancement of voice search optimization.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Also, voice search is more inclusive and extensive in its audience reach owing to its&nbsp;<u>multilingual accessibility</u>, enabling marketers to spread their net wide and&nbsp;<u>reach tier-II and tier-III target segments.</u></strong></p>\n<p>Nothing is lost in translation in the voice search technology&nbsp;as it is multilingual. The majority of the top languages are being supported by voice search apps being developed by many large mobile businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Currently, Google Assistant can understand 30 main languages.</strong></p>\n<p>Not only this, to further broaden audience horizon and improve multilingual choices, new advancements are in progress.</p>\n<p>So users are able to search for products in their native language in which they are most comfortable.</p>\n<p><strong>The voice-based technology does away cultural blocks, enabling marketers to corner markets without any linguistic constraints coming in the way of business communication.</strong></p>\n<p>Not only this, for many&nbsp;senior persons who struggle with hand dexterity due to ageing, voice search tools are a godsend.&nbsp;Senior adults may use this function and several internet amenities with ease.</p>\n<p>Similar to this,&nbsp;illiterate people&nbsp;or&nbsp;those with partial impairments&nbsp;who find it uncomfortable to sit in a typing position can simply shout out their needs and receive results right away.</p>\n<p>Since queries need not be put in black and white, searches become infinitely more efficient and accurate.</p>\n<p><strong>Therefore, it is crucial for companies to use a voice search application since it opens up their brand to a wider audience, including clients who previously couldn&rsquo;t use digital marketing tools owing to numerous typing restrictions.</strong></p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.

By leveraging voice searches that match this type of term, one may improve one&rsquo;s business significantly.</p>\n<p>It has been found that&nbsp;most mobile voice search users look for very local terms.</p>\n<p>As a result, it is crucial to&nbsp;<strong>optimize SEO for &ldquo;near me&rdquo; queries.</strong></p>\n<p>Trends are showing that company are getting incredible traction and spotlight by putting this localized voice search feature into practice.</p>\n<p>If customers are pleased with the results of their voice search, users of any product or service will undoubtedly open a website to view the product specifics.</p>\n<p>If the particular business carefully optimized their website for voice search, they will be able to draw in more visitors than they did previously and expose it to more customers.</p>\n<p>This way, businesses can singularly bag customers in their immediate vicinity and leverage distance to broaden its audience reach and popularity.</p>\n<p>For this reason, it is a good idea to take voice search into account for<strong>&nbsp;Frequently Answered Questions (FAQ) pages in which long-tail keywords can be stuffed in so appropriate responses can be created in a conversational style.</strong></p>\n<p>This, in extension, can turn out to be a huge customer magnet as the approach increases the probability of the business to rank in results when the customers happen to utter the selfsame keywords and localized lingo in their search queries.</p>\n<p>Thus, if you have not optimized your website for voice searches yet, this is the time to fix it.</p>\n<p>The winds have started to blow in the other direction and now, without a doubt,&nbsp;<strong>voice search is the FUTURE.</strong></p>\n</div>",

To evaluate a product&rsquo;s &lsquo;real-life&rsquo; attractiveness, audience consider factors like EDD, returns policies, user reviews, and occasionally even the integrated Instagram feed.</p>\n<p>What does this tell?</p>\n<p><strong>Customers obviously value the pre-purchase experience.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Equally, if not more, important is&nbsp;<u>the post-purchase experience.</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>It decides whether the customer will return to make repeated purchase or not, what kind of reviews the D2C brand will garner, the impression it will make in the market through word-of-mouth, etc.</strong></p>\n<p>Hence, it is not enough to just make the customer place the order.</p>\n<p>Instead, the real art is to sustain the customer and its spending on the brand way into the future until brand loyalty finally takes root.</p>\n<p>So how can that be done?</p>\n<p>What makes a D2C customer keep coming back?</p>\n<p><strong>Statistics reveal that more than 95% of internet buyers follow and track their orders.</strong></p>\n<p>Every day until they receive their shipment, about half of them check the order tracking page.&nbsp;More than once a day, 20% of consumers check the status of their orders.</p>\n<p>This demonstrates the expectation for delivery and the joy following a purchase.</p>\n<p><strong>However,&nbsp;<u>7 out of 10 customers</u>&nbsp;also admit that they would prefer monitoring the tracking status for updates than contact customer service in the event of delays.</strong></p>\n<p>What does this customer behaviour reveal?</p>\n<p><strong>The modern consumer is accustomed to an &ldquo;instant&rdquo; lifestyle.</strong></p>\n<p>The instant dopamine dose is a norm for the D2C buyer, pursuing which it tails the status of its ordered parcel.</p>\n<p>They are no longer accustomed to the slow internet connection and regularly scheduled TV shows. They are used to receiving replies straight away.&nbsp;Their demand for visibility on packages is a clear example of this attribute.</p>\n<p><strong>In this context, for D2C brands, the mentality of the &ldquo;restless shopper&rdquo; can prove to be very advantageous.</strong></p>\n<p>The crux of superior post-purchase experiences boils down to the quality of two things:</p>\n<p><strong>COMMUNICATION AND VISIBILITY</strong></p>\n<p>They work well together to win over customers&rsquo; trust and loyalty by offering alluring transparency and proactive business ethic.</p>\n<p><strong>According to&nbsp;<u>Market Metrics</u>, the probability of selling to an existing happy customer is up to 14 times higher than the probability of selling to a new customer.</strong></p>\n<p>With this goal in mind, here are some essential components that any D2C brand must have in order to elevate their customer&rsquo;s post-purchase experience:</p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Tracking page equals transparency. Every D2C brand must have a custom tracking page.</strong></h6>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-26943\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b5a.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b5a.png 1022w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b5a-300x151.png 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b5a-768x387.png 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1022\" height=\"515\"></figure>\n<p>Although a tracking page is a very straightforward service, it significantly improves the brand&rsquo;s perception among consumers. When customers wanted to check the status of their airway bill number, they were quite happy to visit a courier page.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the amazing selection of shipping software that is presently available, this pointless rigmarole may be safely stowed away.</p>\n<p><em>The trick is to create the monitoring page in accordance with the brand&rsquo;s concept and aesthetic while keeping it clear, thorough, and classy.</em></p>\n<p><strong>For instance, while shopping online, customers don&rsquo;t need to search further for information thanks to the tidy tracking pages provided by&nbsp;<u>Plum Goodness, Wow Science, and The House of Rare.</u></strong></p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Keep notifications true to their word.

Companies need to take notice and update their chatbot technology or risk being left behind.</p>\n<p>Customers are more likely to become irritated by constraints they experience with basic chatbots elsewhere as they begin to use increasingly sophisticated chatbots. Consider Power Users, who are far more likely to have dealt with fixing individualized problems.</p>\n<p><strong>According to 65% of Power Users, they are more likely to leave a business due to a negative experience with a chatbot.</strong>&nbsp;This emphasises how crucial it is for businesses to raise the bar for what their chatbots can provide.</p>\n<p>Power Users&rsquo; business may be retained if sophisticated support features like conversational answers and personalization are implemented.</p>\n<p>So far, things are on the right track:</p>\n<p><strong>Nearly half (47%) of chatbot users think it&rsquo;s possible they have mistaken a chatbot for a live customer support agent, and another 11% are not sure, a sign that chatbot technology is advancing rapidly.</strong></p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Support teams should treat chatbots like an extension of the team.</strong></h6>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-26940\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b4c-1024x585.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b4c-1024x585.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b4c-300x171.jpg 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b4c-768x439.jpg 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b4c.jpg 1400w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"585\"></figure>\n<p>After a live agent chat and a phone call, chatbots are the third most common way to get customer care help. In other words, employees can relax knowing that chatbots will not endanger real agents.</p>\n<p>Instead, chatbots should be a part of a comprehensive customer service strategy since they assist and complement human employees.</p>\n<p><strong>Additionally, while human operators are seen as the most useful support choices, chatbots are also seen favourably by more than two thirds (69%) of respondents.</strong></p>\n<p>Businesses have to take advantage of this rapidly expanding market as chatbot usage increases among customers and technology advances.</p>\n<p>NEWS FLASH: Online fashion retailer&nbsp;Myntra&nbsp;recently integrated&nbsp;<strong>MyFashionGPT</strong>&nbsp;to assist customers in searching products and trying styles.</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;We are arguably the first fashion, beauty and lifestyle platform, globally, to roll out this feature to the entire customer base at this scale,&rdquo; said Raghu Krishnananda, chief product and technology officer at Myntra.</em></p>\n<p><strong>MyFashion GPT</strong>&nbsp;enables Myntra shoppers to search for a specific fashion product by typing text in a manner resembling natural speech. Customers will be shown up to six ensemble options, including products across multiple categories like dresses, footwear, accessories, or makeup.</p>\n<p>If asked &ldquo;<em>what can I wear for a wedding in Jaipur?</em>&rdquo;, the feature will show results that include sarees, salwars, lipsticks, and footwear from Myntra&rsquo;s collection of more than 2.1 million styles.</p>\n<p><strong>Some of these queries include; &lsquo;<em>I want to go to Goa in May, what should I wear? And I like blue&rsquo;, &lsquo;what should I wear to a Leh bike trip?&rsquo;</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thus, the inserted chatbot has been enhancing and assisting shopper experience at Myntra with added zest and convenience.</strong></p>\n<p>As innovations in chatbot technology continue to leap forward and consumer usage surges, there&rsquo;s no question intelligent chatbots are reshaping consumer expectations and the future of customer support.</p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content clear\" itemprop=\"text\">\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p>In marketing, there is more than one way to skin a cat. This is because when it comes to planning digital campaigns and producing content, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. What works for one may completely tank for another.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For instance, different types of content like <strong>feed</strong> <strong>based, search engine based, viral/trending work best</strong> <strong>depending</strong> <strong>on a</strong> <strong>number</strong> <strong>of factors, such as the</strong> <strong>target</strong> <strong>audience, the goals of the</strong> <strong>campaign, and the</strong> <strong>resources</strong> <strong>available</strong> <strong>to put</strong> <strong>together</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>campaign</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They are all means to the same end but marketers like to take the path of least resistance, one that will convert online engagement into concrete conversions and sales in quantified terms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>And</em></strong> <strong><em>different</em></strong> <strong><em>strokes work for</em></strong> <strong><em>different</em></strong> <strong><em>folks, people!</em></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are three different types of content distribution channels that marketer use to peddle their content bank:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1. Feed-based content:</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-26932\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b3a-300x211.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b3a-300x211.png 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b3a-768x540.png 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/b3a.png 948w\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"324\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Feed-based content is content that is administered reading the online behaviour and preference of the user. Based on the <strong>user</strong> <strong>activity and interests,</strong> feed-based content is delivered to users in a <strong>personalized</strong> <strong>pastiche through social media</strong> <strong>platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and</strong> <strong>Instagram</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><u>Visual content and graphics are highly</u> <u>effective</u> <u>in feed-based platforms.</u></p>\n<p>In this medium, visual communication help spread the word as well as the reach of digital campaigns by leaps and bounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>According to a study by </strong><strong><u>Buffer</u></strong><strong>, posts with images receive </strong><strong>150% more retweets</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>89%</strong> <strong>more likes on <u>Twitter</u></strong><strong> compared to posts without images.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It must be noted that feed-based content works particularly well for reaching audience who are <strong>already</strong> <strong>familiar</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>engaged</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>brand or harbour an interest in the</strong> <strong>relevant</strong> <strong>industry</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The case study of Cadbury Dairy Milk and its marketing tactic makes the case in point. In 2021, <u>Cadbury Dairy Milk</u> launched the <strong>&ldquo;Say It With Silk&rdquo;</strong> campaign on Instagram that actively invited the users to participate and order personalized silk bars to be made with customized messages engraved on the chocolate bars for their loved ones.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The campaign relied on feed-based content, with Cadbury sharing <u>user-generated content featuring the personalized silk bars on their feed.</u> The campaign was a massive success, generating over </strong><strong>20,000 entries</strong><strong> and increasing brand engagement on Instagram.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apart from this, Zomato&rsquo;s <strong>#OrderForAFriend</strong> Campaign in 2021 also amped up its product positioning. By <strong>encouraging</strong> <strong>users to place</strong> <strong>orders</strong> <strong>for their friends and to share</strong> <strong>visual clippings of their</strong> <strong>experiences</strong> <strong>on</strong> <strong>Instagram</strong>, the food delivery platform made waves by leveraging the feed-based medium.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, a <strong>report by </strong><strong><u>Hootsuite</u></strong> <strong>found that </strong><strong>Instagram Stories are used by over </strong><strong>500 million</strong> <strong>users daily</strong><strong>,</strong> <strong>making them a highly effective way to reach a wide audience through a feed-based platform.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zomato precisely took advantage of this and fashioned its digital campaign to rely heavily on feed-based content, strategically sharing oodles of user-generated content featuring the food packages ordered for friends on their feed. As a result, #OrderForAFriend was a massive success, generating entries, brand participation on Instagram, and exponentially multiplied food orders for Zomato left and right.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2.

In addition to sweetening the deal with offers, <strong>Amazon India optimised its website to become an e-commerce magnet by generously using relevant keywords to improve its search engine rankings.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>In a study by </strong><strong><u>Google</u></strong><strong>, it was found that</strong><strong> 50% </strong><strong>of B2B search queries today are made on smartphones, and mobile searches related to &ldquo;best&rdquo; and &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; have grown by over </strong><strong>80%</strong><strong> in the past two years. </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Evidently, the survey hints at the need of producing high-quality search engine-based content that is optimized for mobile search.</p>\n<p>Hence, no wonder, the &ldquo;Great Indian Festival&rdquo; campaign was a towering success that dexterously generated billions of website visits and increased the number of orders placed on Amazon India.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Byju&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fall in Love with Learning&rdquo; Campaign:</strong> In the year 2022, edtech platform Byju&rsquo;s launched its &ldquo;Fall in Love with Learning&rdquo; campaign. The reason it became a buzzword on Google was because the campaign depended heavily on search engine optimization to garner engagement on its website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The campaign also offered users a free trial of its learning app to get leads in addition to bunching a number of relevant keywords to improve its search engine rankings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A report by the</strong><strong><u> Content Marketing Institute</u></strong><strong> found that </strong><strong>72% </strong><strong>of B2B marketers use content marketing to generate leads, with search engine optimization being a key component of their strategy.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus, following the search engine- based content marketing, Byju&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fall in Love with Learning&rdquo; campaign was a show stopping hit, setting the stage for millions of website visits and escalating the number of app downloads for Byju&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3.

Viral or trending content spreads quickly and widely across the internet, either through the social media sharing or the word-of-mouth grapevine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the biggest advantage of a viral content piece is that it wraps a large audience around its finger, commands a formidable influence on many minds and helps make long lasting impressions in digital campaigns.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>For instance, in a study by </strong><strong><u>BuzzSumo</u></strong><strong>, it was found that content that generates high levels of social media engagement in the shape of shares, likes, comments, also tends to rank highly in search engine results, suggesting that viral content can have a promising impact on both social media and search engine visibility. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Thus, viral content can effectively do the combined work of search engine based content if it somehow manages to latch on the trending bandwagon of internet sensation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of digital campaigns that skyrocketed owing to them achieving epic viral proportions on the internet:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fevicol&rsquo;s &ldquo;Subah Uthke Kuch Naya Banate Hain&rdquo; Campaign: </strong>In 2021, Fevicol came under the spotlight when it launched its DIY digital outreach named &ldquo;Subah Uthke Kuch Naya Banate Hain&rdquo; that <u>urged the internet to share their do-it-yourself stories related to home improvement projects on the platform. </u></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to its participatory nature, the campaign went viral as it reinforced the inclusive theme of building intimate bonds with the Fevicol brand. Thousands of users participated and shared their creative ideas on social media. </em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A report by </strong><strong><u>Socialbakers</u></strong> <strong>found that viral content on Facebook generates an average of</strong><strong> 258% more engagement </strong><strong>than non-viral content. </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This indicates the potential for viral content to dominate social media activity, effectively justifying why Fevicol was able to amplify its brand awareness and secure a massive victory in its online advertising endeavor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Swiggy&rsquo;s #SwiggyVoiceOfHunger Campaign:</strong> In 2021, food delivery app Swiggy launched the #SwiggyVoiceOfHunger campaign on social media, which <u>encouraged users to share their &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; voice on the platform.</u></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The campaign went viral, with millions of users participating and sharing their voice recordings. Naturally, Swiggy saw a colossal increase in its online presence, with users chanting its name on social media in a fit of heightened allegiance to the brand and its espoused social cause.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zomato&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ordering vs. Cooking&rdquo; Campaign:</strong> In 2020, food delivery app Zomato launched a series of ads on social media that compared the experience of ordering food with the experience of cooking. <u>The ads were humorous and relatable, and quickly went viral on social media,</u> driving significant engagement and media attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a result, <strong>Zomato saw a 60% increase in brand mentions</strong> on social media during the campaign.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thus, even though viral content is highly conducive to brand promotion, feed-based and search engine-based content are no less of trailblazers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In general, a well-rounded digital campaign will likely incorporate a mix of these different content distribution channels, tailored to the specific goals and audience of the campaign. It&rsquo;s also important to track and analyze the performance of different types of content to determine what works best for your brand and adjust your strategy accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

started to recognize the potential of reaching a global audience through websites, search engines, and online directories. </em></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With this in mind, strategies were

digital.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>From generic to segmented targeting.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Thus, this opened portals to experimenting with targeted advertising, giving

It parades the goods under the nose of the customer, tempting them with a preview of what they can enjoy should they buy the product.</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Although many unboxing videos are created by users, seeing the hike in its popularity, companies and brands are also getting on the bandwagon.<br><strong>These videos not only document the experience of opening a product, but they often dramatize it and, in turn, take on a quirky, playful spirit, showcasing products in all of their freshly unopened glory.</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>No wonder, as per the analytics, there are over 20 million YouTube results for &ldquo;unboxing.&rdquo; </strong><br><strong>Plus, according to Google Consumer Surveys, one in five consumers say they have actually seen an unboxing video.</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>In this vein, research on online behaviour concludes that if a brand provides customers with an exciting packaging experience, they are more likely to share it and eventually even buy it.<br>&nbsp;<br>This user-generated content can maximize brand awareness and help marketers scoop out a major chunk of the visiting traffic for themselves.<br>Because customers today actively seek out videos on unboxing.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, 55% of people use videos to help make purchasing decisions (Source: Google)<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>So below are 5 ways brands can weave a memorable unboxing experience for customers:</strong><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Use Branded Packaging for Exclusive Brand Recall.</strong></h6>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img class=\"wp-image-26916\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1a-1.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1a-1.jpg 980w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1a-1-300x147.jpg 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1a-1-768x376.jpg 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"480\"></figure>\n<p>Your packaging is the first thing a customer sees when their delivery arrives so the unboxing experience begins before they even open it. They&rsquo;ve ordered your product and have been waiting for its arrival so the anticipation is already there.<br>So you need to make it clear who this package is from by ensuring your logo or company name is visible and popping out for good.<br>Adding an eye-catching design to your packaging will help to make your brand instantly recognizable.<br>Providing the case in point, <u>Tiffany &amp; Co.</u> has designed one of the most successful unboxing experiences.<br><strong>Their Tiffany blue jewelry boxes are just as iconic as their engagement rings, with the colour itself being trademarked. The box alone has become a representation of luxury and exclusivity worldwide. And today it has its own product page and can even be bought as a sterling silver charm. </strong><br>Simply put, unboxing videos uptick the branding quotient exponentially. This is the power of unboxing, when the experience becomes just as valuable as the product itself.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Leverage the utility factor:</strong></h6>\n<p>Unboxing videos have a practical component in addition to the emotional reaction they provoke.<br><strong>In a study Google conducted with TNS and Ogilvy, the former discovered that 66% of beauty product buyers stated YouTube helped them picture the item they were going to buy. </strong><br><strong>This is particularly true for brands like <u>Maybelline, Sugar Cosmetics, Plum, Faces Canada</u> that roll out unboxing videos for their lipstick collections so that the female demographic can get a better view of the shades and act on their choices better after watching the &ldquo;lipstick swatches.&rdquo; </strong><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><em>It therefore comes as no surprise that 62% of those who watch unboxing videos do so in order to investigate a particular product, as per the most current Google Consumer Surveys. </em><br>&nbsp;<br>By providing customers with the best unboxing experience before they can see or physically touch your product, brands also validate their product&rsquo;s worth.<br>&nbsp;<br>And in this way, unboxing videos can significantly assist people in their buying decisions while disseminating helpful product information.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-26917\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1b-1.webp\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1b-1.webp 800w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1b-1-300x295.webp 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1b-1-768x755.webp 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"786\"></figure>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Make it sustainable:</strong></h6>\n<p>Your packaging is a reflection of your brand values.<br>So if you&rsquo;re a sustainable business, sell sustainable products, or are simply looking to be more sustainable, this should be reflected in the packaging you create.<br>This gives out the message that you are not just talking your talk but also walking it, building authenticity and trust among your target audience.<br>Make an effort to be as environmentally responsible as you can during the unboxing experience. Inform your clients about the ecological packaging you are using. Inform them of the reasons for your packaging selection and the best ways to get rid of it without harming the environment.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>For example, the upbeat shampoo brand, &ldquo;Love Beauty and Planet&rdquo; makes its vibrant bottles from Post-Consumer Recycled (PCR) material.&nbsp; </strong><br>The bottles are made from recycled material and the packaging testifies to that. Their transparent bottles are not 100% see-through and boasts of using sustainable, conscious methods that are both eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not only this, <u>Love Beauty and Planet has teamed up with recycling innovators TerraCycle.</u> The brand is rethinking packaging to help solve the problem of disposability with the goal of eliminating waste from their product lifecycle.<br>For this reason, Love Beauty and Planet has repackaged their products in durable and recyclable bottles with zero-waste labels.<br><strong>This fresh new approach to packaging design is all part of their commitment to do #smallactsoflove for a more beautiful planet.</strong><br>The company has committed that by 2030, 100% of its product and packaging portfolio will allow for people-and-planet friendly disposal and this is something that is strongly being espoused in their packaging.<br>No wonder, the Unilever product is doing so well what with its packaging making a strong case for itself and garnering immense support and positive response from the market audience.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img class=\"wp-image-26918\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: auto;\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1c-1.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1c-1.jpg 800w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1c-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1c-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"></figure>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Add a personal touch:</strong></h6>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img class=\"wp-image-26921\" src=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1d-1-1024x606.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1d-1-1024x606.jpg 1024w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1d-1-300x178.jpg 300w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1d-1-768x455.jpg 768w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1d-1-1536x909.jpg 1536w, https://blogs.digitallynext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b1d-1.jpg 1600w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"606\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure>\n<p>Making your packaging look tailor-made and singularly crafted helps make the consumer feel appreciated.<br><strong>A handwritten thank you note, for instance, may strengthen the human connection people have with your company. </strong><br>Your consumer now knows that their order was assembled individually before being packaged and sent.<br>However, a handwritten message isn&rsquo;t always scalable. Therefore, printing bespoke notes may be a more practical choice for your company.<br>To add a sense of luxury, you may instead decide to exclusively include handwritten notes with expensive or limited-edition goods.<br>Including a complimentary gift, sample, or discount voucher for further items is another method to customize the package.<br>The cardinal rule in this situation is that it must go with the item that your consumer has ordered.<br><em>For instance, if you own a skincare company and a customer wants grapefruit body soap, send them a sample of the corresponding body lotion as well. </em><br><strong>This shows your customer you&rsquo;ve paid attention to their preferences and might lead them to purchase the regular version in their next order.</strong></p>\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Keep the customer in mind:</strong></h6>\n<p>Picture your customer as you put together their unboxing experience.<br>Basically, jump into their shoes and walk around in it while you are curating the parcel to be unboxed.<br>Then see if the following questions check the boxes:<br><strong><em>Is your packaging easy to open? </em></strong><br><strong><em>Will the contents of your packaging remain intact during delivery? </em></strong><br><strong><em>Is the unboxing experience you&rsquo;ve created easy to follow?</em></strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Think about what would help the customer get the most out of their interaction with your brand and feel truly satisfied.<br>The packaging should be user-friendly. Make sure the customer is able to open their parcel without destroying it, or your product, in the process.<br>And if you&rsquo;re shipping a product that has multiple parts, consider the best way to present these.<br>When items aren&rsquo;t packaged securely, they can fall apart or look untidy to the customer on arrival.<br>Which leads to a messy unboxing and a disjointed narrative of your brand.<br>&nbsp;<br>Unboxing is one of the few moments when you have the customers&rsquo; undivided attention.<br>And in digital marketing, this opens portals of opportunities for product advancement.<br>&nbsp;<br>The unboxing experience says a lot about your brand. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to build a connection with your customer and to add more value to their experience than anticipated.<br>So for this reason, it is absolutely imperative to get it right because every brand is only given one chance. So make sure you make the most out of it!</p>",
